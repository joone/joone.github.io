			<p>It has been 30 years since Apple was founded on 1 April 2006 (1976 - 2006).  It was a long history than I expected compared to Microsoft. </p>
<p>Apple is a computer manufacturer and MS is a software company. Two companies have helped each other and also have a competitive relationship. Two companies are developing different operating system, but MS is developing software for Mac. </p>
<p>It is interesting that the first version of MS Excel was for Mac and Internet Explorer was the official web browser of Mac before releasing Safari. But now, two companies compete more than before. Apple is also developing an office software.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, Apple had to struggle to survive so Steve Jobs could return with his company NEXT and wrote a successful story with Mac OS X and iMac series. It may be said that Apple is at the turning point in the success of iPod and iTunes Music Store. As a result, Apple is not only a computer manufacturer but also a CE maker &amp; contents provider. I expect that Apple would lead the technology of computer &amp; CE device areas in term of innovations and makes computing environment easier and comfortable.
