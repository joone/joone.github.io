			<p>Many things around me was changed these days.<br>
I got married so I lived with my wife in my new house.<br>
The office that I work was moved to another city so I come to the office by bus<br>
In addition, I got a new job that was unusual which I had not worked on before.</p>
<p>Actually, these changes sometimes make me confuse.<br>
I am adapting myself to the new circumstances.</p>
