			<p>Apple had leaded the personal computer market until the beginning of 80s before IBM released the IBM-PC. Apple also created new personal computer, the Macintosh that provides the GUI firstly. It was very innovative.<br>
However, IBM-PC had become the mainstream of the personal computer. IBM opened the architecture of the computer and many computer manufacturers could make compatible IBM-PCs. Microsoft provided a DOS &amp; Windows as an OS for the PCs. It was not innovative and easy to use, but it was cheaper than the Macintosh.</p>
<p>The Macintosh is very popular to designers, students and teachers. But it is insufficient to become a mainstream of personal computer. Apple has still fewer than 10% of the market share of personal computer. Most of PC is now using Microsoft Windows.<br>
Now, it is not important issue, because Apple is not just a computer manufacturer any more. Apple changed their business way now to be an electric consumer company like SONY, SAMSUNG. The success of iPod can make Apple changed.</p>
<p>I am looking foward to activities of Apple from now on.</p>
