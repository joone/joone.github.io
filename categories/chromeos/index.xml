      <description>Recently, WS was replaced with WS2:
  1144255 window-service: removes mus_demo, test_wm, and some unnecessary deps
  Issue 865689Â Remove window-service
  I ran mus_demo to test ozone-gbm, but now it&amp;rsquo;s gone. :-( So, I need to figure it out what is the difference between WS1 and WS2.
What is the Window Service of ChromeOS? Window Service is a kind of Window Compositor like Weston. It is a separate process from the browser process in CrOS.</description>

      <description>Ozone-Wayland is an Ozone implementation of Chromium, which allows to run Crosswalk and Chromium browser natively on Wayland without any X11 dependence[1].
I have been working on Ozone-Wayland recently. There were two releases since I was involved in the development. In the latest release, I contributed the virtual keyboard support to Ozone-Wayland. You can find how it works in the following video:
The ozone-wayland team has been focusing on graphics accelerations such as WebGL, Canvas 2D, Accelerated Compositing on Wayland.</description>
