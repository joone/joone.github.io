      <description>I attended BlinkOn9 from April 18 to 19, 2019. Here is the official page: bit.ly/blinkon9-info, presentations, and Lightning Talks.
At this conference, I talked about acelerating graphics performance with ozone-gbm on Intel based Linux desktop systems: explained what kind of hardware accelerations have been applied to Intel -based Chromebook and how we can use them on a Linux desktop.
Here is a demo video on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY7X6vWD_wo</description>

      <title>Enable to open multiple file-pickers in Chromium for Linux</title>

      <description>Sometimes, we don&amp;rsquo;t know exact requirements or expect user behaviors while developing or fix something. I fixed the file-picker modal issue in Chromium for Linux last year. At that time, the reviewer and I thought that there would be no case to pop-up multiple file-pickers, but it happened since M55 when you follow the following steps:
Enable &amp;ldquo;Ask where to save&amp;rdquo; in settings. Open 2 tabs of e.g.: https://sourceforge.net/projects/azureus/files/latest/download Wait for 2 downloader windows, and close/cancel/etc both Freeze or crash Here is a video to reproduce the problem.</description>

      <title>Apple-style-span class was fully removed from Blink</title>

      <guid>/post/apple-style-span-class-was-fully/</guid>
      <description>Finally, Apple-style-span class was fully removed from Blink(commit).
Apple-style-span has not been produced since 2011: https://webkit.org/blog/1737/apple-style-span-is-gone, but there were still some legacy code to handle Apple-style-span class because old WebKit engines has produced it, but now the usage is quite low(&amp;lt;=0.0001%). So, we decided to remove it from Blink at BlinkOn7. The code was executed whenever the users copy a text or run Editing APIs(document.execCommand) to keep the styles when pasting it.</description>

Building your own browser is the best way to find bugs and fix them. Now, I&amp;rsquo;d like to introduce how to build Chromium on your mac. I think that the latest code seems more stable(?) and provides more features.
This is a starting point to build Chromium on Mac OS X.

Installing the depot-tools http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/install-gclient
$ svn co http://src.chromium.org/svn/trunk/tools/depot_tools
Add depot_tools to your PATH:</description>
