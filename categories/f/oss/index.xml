      <description>I attended OSCON 2014 held in Portland, Oregon. I think Portland is the Mecca of Open Source because OSCON is held there every year and Intel Open Source Technology center is also in Hillsboro near Portland. In addition, Linus Torvalds is based in Portland.
I wanted to attend some sessions this year, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t see many topics related to my job. There are more high-level topics above system level. Anyway, it&amp;rsquo;s great to hear voices from web developers as a web engine developer.</description>

      <description>Next week he is going to vist Korea to address the new GPL and free software.
He plans to attend a conference &amp;amp; serveal lecture meeting.
I think that it&amp;rsquo;s good chance to understand the new GPL and free software from RMS directly. ( He wants to call him RMS)
For more information, click the following sites.
Thanks.
