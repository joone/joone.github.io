      <description>I began to work on the Servo project. Actually, my first open source project was Mozilla and also I was involved in the Korea Mozilla community. During the time, I contributed to Fennec browser by fixing bugs and localization. Anyway, this blog article motivated me work on Mozilla again.
I landed a simple patch and am working on adding the ellipse API to Canvas API. I see many missing features so it looks like the blue ocean for me compared to the Chromium project.</description>
