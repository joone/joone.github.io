    I had used GNOME Clutter project before when I worked on Accelerated Compositing in the WebKit clutter port. At that time, I implemented my own Actor by extending the existing Actor APIs. It worked well: I managed to run some CSS 3D animation demos in the WebKit Clutter port.
Unfortunately, the Clutter project lost its way. Now, the project is almost deprecated although it is still used in GNOME Shell. Anyway, I had a dream of maintaining a project like Clutter so personally, I have worked on C++ implementation of scene graph engine using OpenGL so I also have a Rust implentation.

    History I fixed a caret color issue in WebKit in 2013, but I found out there was a regression, which made me work this issue again and finally fixed it. o/ It was a bit hard for me because I had not worked on WebKit since Chromium forked from the WebKit project in 2013.
The source code has been changed and I almost forgot how to deal with layout test errors.

    Recently, WS was replaced with WS2:
  1144255 window-service: removes mus_demo, test_wm, and some unnecessary deps
  Issue 865689 Remove window-service
  I ran mus_demo to test ozone-gbm, but now it&rsquo;s gone. :-( So, I need to figure it out what is the difference between WS1 and WS2.
What is the Window Service of ChromeOS? Window Service is a kind of Window Compositor like Weston. It is a separate process from the browser process in CrOS.

    Recently, ChromeOS started to support Linux applications on ChomeOS. Google hasn&rsquo;t allowed ChromeOS to run native applications due to security reasons. Finally, they found a way to support Linux applications through the container technology.
It is worth to read a discussion on CrOSVM on Hacker News because the original author joined the discussion. Here is the article about the ChromeOS Linux container. https://www.zdnet.com/article/chrome-os-could-be-getting-containers-for-running-linux-vms/
There is a Youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9mrR2tqVbQ

    Recently, I published a blog article about making Use Of Chrome&rsquo;s Ozone-GBM Intel Graphics Support On The Linux Desktop. This is about using ChromeOS graphics stack for a regular Linux system. This article was also mentioned in Phoronix.
Originally, my old colleague started working on this a long time ago, but it has been broken since then. So I have been trying to enable ozone-gbm on a Linux system because this solution would be useful for embedded systems.

    I was surprised that there are many low-level graphics projects written in Rust and I started looking into one of them: drm-rs. Then, I added an example for handling page-flip event.
drm-rs is a subproject of Smithay that is a wayland compositor written in Rust. It allows Rust applications to access the Direct Rendering Manger(DRM), a subsystem of the Linux Kernel. So, we could directly paint something into a frame buffer and render it on the display using DRM APIs.

    I attended BlinkOn9 from April 18 to 19, 2019. Here is the official page: bit.ly/blinkon9-info, presentations, and Lightning Talks.
At this conference, I talked about acelerating graphics performance with ozone-gbm on Intel based Linux desktop systems: explained what kind of hardware accelerations have been applied to Intel -based Chromebook and how we can use them on a Linux desktop.

    If your server or host PC supports NFS, you can set up shared directories for OpenStep. For example, if the shared folder is nfs://192.168.1.19/nfs/ftp, you can add the imported directory in NFSManager.app as follows:

Run mount command in OpenStep to mount a remote directory as follows:``` $ mount -t 192.168.8.16:/mnt/openstep /coreonion

    NextStep is one of the advanced operating systems in 90s. You may understand why it is by watching this video:
Every features Steve Jobs introduced in this video was possible in 1992, which is amazing. So I&rsquo;ve dreamed of using NextStep since I was aware of it, but I&rsquo;ve never seen a running demo and just saw a NexTCube. By chance, I found instructions how to install OpenStep 4.2 on Parallels.

    I began to work on the Servo project. Actually, my first open source project was Mozilla and also I was involved in the Korea Mozilla community. During the time, I contributed to Fennec browser by fixing bugs and localization. Anyway, this blog article motivated me work on Mozilla again.
I landed a simple patch and am working on adding the ellipse API to Canvas API. I see many missing features so it looks like the blue ocean for me compared to the Chromium project.
