      <description>I had used GNOME Clutter project much a long time ago when I worked on Accelerated Compositing in the WebKit clutter port. At that time, I implemented my own Actor by extending the existing Actor APIs. It worked well very well: I managed to run some CSS 3D animation demo in the WebKit Clutter port.
Unfortunately, the Clutter project lost its way to grow up. Now, the project is almost deprecated although it is still used in GNOME Shell.</description>

      <description>History I fixed a caret color issue in WebKit in 2013, but I found out there was a regression, which made me work this issue again and finally fixed it. o/ It was a bit hard for me because I had not worked on WebKit since Chromium forked from the WebKit project in 2013.
The source code has been changed and I almost forgot how to deal with layout test errors.</description>

      <description>Recently, WS was replaced with WS2:
  1144255 window-service: removes mus_demo, test_wm, and some unnecessary deps
  Issue 865689 Remove window-service
  I ran mus_demo to test ozone-gbm, but now it&amp;rsquo;s gone. :-( So, I need to figure it out what is the difference between WS1 and WS2.
What is the Window Service of ChromeOS? Window Service is a kind of Window Compositor like Weston. It is a separate process from the browser process in CrOS.</description>

      <description>Recently, ChromeOS started to support Linux applications on ChomeOS. Google hasn&amp;rsquo;t allowed ChromeOS to run native applications due to security reasons. Finally, they found a way to support Linux applications through the container technology.
It is worth to read a discussion on CrOSVM on Hacker News because the original author joined the discussion. Here is the article about the ChromeOS Linux container. https://www.zdnet.com/article/chrome-os-could-be-getting-containers-for-running-linux-vms/
There is a Youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9mrR2tqVbQ

      <description>Recently, I published a blog article about making Use Of Chrome&amp;rsquo;s Ozone-GBM Intel Graphics Support On The Linux Desktop. This is about using ChromeOS graphics stack for a regular Linux system. This article was also mentioned in Phoronix.
Originally, my old colleague started working on this a long time ago, but it has been broken since then. So I have been trying to enable ozone-gbm on a Linux system because this solution would be useful for embedded systems.</description>

      <description>I was surprised that there are many low-level graphics projects written in Rust and I started looking into one of them: drm-rs. Then, I added an example for handling page-flip event.
drm-rs is a subproject of Smithay that is a wayland compositor written in Rust. It allows Rust applications to access the Direct Rendering Manger(DRM), a subsystem of the Linux Kernel. So, we could directly paint something into a frame buffer and render it on the display using DRM APIs.</description>

      <description>I attended BlinkOn9 from April 18 to 19, 2019. Here is the official page: bit.ly/blinkon9-info, presentations, and Lightning Talks.
At this conference, I talked about acelerating graphics performance with ozone-gbm on Intel based Linux desktop systems: explained what kind of hardware accelerations have been applied to Intel -based Chromebook and how we can use them on a Linux desktop.
Here is a demo video on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY7X6vWD_wo</description>

      <description>If your server or host PC supports NFS, you can set up shared directories for OpenStep. For example, if the shared folder is nfs://192.168.1.19/nfs/ftp, you can add the imported directory in NFSManager.app as follows:

Run mount command in OpenStep to mount a remote directory as follows:``` $ mount -t 192.168.8.16:/mnt/openstep /coreonion

      <description>NextStep is one of the advanced operating systems in 90s. You may understand why it is by watching this video:
Every features Steve Jobs introduced in this video was possible in 1992, which is amazing. So I&amp;rsquo;ve dreamed of using NextStep since I was aware of it, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen a running demo and just saw a NexTCube. By chance, I found instructions how to install OpenStep 4.2 on Parallels.</description>

      <description>I began to work on the Servo project. Actually, my first open source project was Mozilla and also I was involved in the Korea Mozilla community. During the time, I contributed to Fennec browser by fixing bugs and localization. Anyway, this blog article motivated me work on Mozilla again.
I landed a simple patch and am working on adding the ellipse API to Canvas API. I see many missing features so it looks like the blue ocean for me compared to the Chromium project.</description>

      <title>Enable to open multiple file-pickers in Chromium for Linux</title>

      <description>Sometimes, we don&amp;rsquo;t know exact requirements or expect user behaviors while developing or fix something. I fixed the file-picker modal issue in Chromium for Linux last year. At that time, the reviewer and I thought that there would be no case to pop-up multiple file-pickers, but it happened since M55 when you follow the following steps:
 Enable &amp;ldquo;Ask where to save&amp;rdquo; in settings. Open 2 tabs of e.g.: https://sourceforge.net/projects/azureus/files/latest/download Wait for 2 downloader windows, and close/cancel/etc both Freeze or crash  Here is a video to reproduce the problem.</description>

      <title>Apple-style-span class was fully removed from Blink</title>

      <guid>/post/apple-style-span-class-was-fully/</guid>
      <description>Finally, Apple-style-span class was fully removed from Blink(commit).
Apple-style-span has not been produced since 2011: https://webkit.org/blog/1737/apple-style-span-is-gone, but there were still some legacy code to handle Apple-style-span class because old WebKit engines has produced it, but now the usage is quite low(&amp;lt;=0.0001%). So, we decided to remove it from Blink at BlinkOn7. The code was executed whenever the users copy a text or run Editing APIs(document.execCommand) to keep the styles when pasting it.</description>

      <description>When I stared working on Chromium, I found a bug in Chromium for Linux: the file-picker was not modal. So, while opening a file-picker, the users could control the main window. Sometimes, it caused mis-behaviors such as we were able to send an email while attaching a file.
There was already a bug and it seemed easy to fix it, but, it took 2 years to fully fix the problem.</description>

      <description>I attended OSCON 2014 held in Portland, Oregon. I think Portland is the Mecca of Open Source because OSCON is held there every year and Intel Open Source Technology center is also in Hillsboro near Portland. In addition, Linus Torvalds is based in Portland.
I wanted to attend some sessions this year, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t see many topics related to my job. There are more high-level topics above system level. Anyway, it&amp;rsquo;s great to hear voices from web developers as a web engine developer.</description>

      <description>Ozone-Wayland is an Ozone implementation of Chromium, which allows to run Crosswalk and Chromium browser natively on Wayland without any X11 dependence[1].
I have been working on Ozone-Wayland recently. There were two releases since I was involved in the development. In the latest release, I contributed the virtual keyboard support to Ozone-Wayland. You can find how it works in the following video:
The ozone-wayland team has been focusing on graphics accelerations such as WebGL, Canvas 2D, Accelerated Compositing on Wayland.</description>

      <description>This year, I experienced Halloween, Thanksgiving day, and Christmas with my family for the first time since I moved to the US. There were many new things I learned about these holidays, so I’d like to share them with you.
Many Koreans know about Halloween because the young Korean people who had studied in the US started bringing Halloween customs back to South Korea and enjoying Halloween there since the 2000s and the majority of kindergartens have a Halloween costume party these days, but Halloween is still not commonly celebrated in Korea, so it’s very hard to find a person wearing a Halloween costume on the streets on Halloween.</description>

      <description>Can you believe that a Kpop song reached no.1 on iTunes in 31 countries?, even though this Kpop song is not an English song, but a Korean song that is called “Gangnam style” by PSY. Actually, nobody expected that this song could become a great hit wordwide, but this song has been spread all over the world very quickly due to Youtube. In this article, I am going to talk about why “Gangnam style” became more popular than other typical Kpop idol songs.</description>

      <description>It’s been almost 3 months since I started using a Nokia N9 as my secondary phone, which is a Linux based smart phone released by Nokia on October 2011. In this post, I will introduce what Nokia N9 is and how to use it in Korea, because it adopts an open source mobile platform which means that anyone can be involved with the project.
Nokia N9
Unfortunately, N9 is the first and last MeeGo phone, but it seems to be close to the Maemo platform, because it uses Qt as the UI framework and the Debian package system.</description>

      <description>After I read this blog post, I applied for membership in the GNOME Foundation. Finally, my application was accepted last week. I think that my WebKitGtk+ contribution and GNOME Korea activities could count towards membership.
The main reason why I decided to become a GNOME foundation member is to let GNOME folks know about the GNOME Korea community(http://gnome.or.kr). The GNOME Korea community started to translate for GNOME in 1998, and is mainly working on Korean translation(http://l10n.</description>

This is not upstreamed yet, but Imy patches are getting reviewed. Gustavo and Martin are helping me write more good patches. Thanks!
I think that this hackfest was done well. You can check more news about the WebKitGtk+ hackfest from other blog posts:</description>

They invited many developers &amp;amp; user communities to the conference, so the GNOME Korea community had a chance to introduce GNOME3 and the community to the attendees.
I was so glad to introduce GNOME3.2 and the infra technology like GTK+, Clutter, GStreamer, WebKitGtk+, Telepathy and GObject-Introspection. Here are the slides and some photos.</description>

In this post, I’m going to tell you more about the mobile features of the WebKit engine and how to enable each feature when you build WebKitGtk+.
First of all, the WebKit engine is particularly strong in the mobile area, because it is lighter and faster than other browser engines and has been verified by the success of Safari on the iPhone.</description>

In this post, I am going to introduce you to what we talk about in the WebKit meeting.
As you know, WebKit is the hottest open source project these days, because most mobile phones use the WebKit engine and additionally Chrome and Safari also are based on WebKit.</description>

      <description>When did you start using a PC? In my case, I started to use computers when I was in university. At that time, it was very difficult for general users to use a computer, because we had to memorize the commands and the directory path, which an executable file is located in. Even using a mouse was optional to use PCs. However, the computing environment has changed rapidly since Windows and the Web were introduced in the 1990s.</description>

      <description>(c) 2010 Diegoe
I attended the WebKitGtk+ Hackfest held in the Igalia Office, located in Coruña, Spain, in this month. It was a great opportunity for me to meet the WebKitGtk+maintainers directly. This hackfest was sponsored by Collabora and Igalia. The Igalia office was very nice; it can be compared to the Google office in terms of the atmosphere. There were free snacks, beverage and game consoles in the office.</description>

      <description>Have you heard about Jeju Olle-gil (제주 올레길)[1] or Jirisan Dulle-gil(지리산 둘레길)? They are famous trails in Korea to hike in the rural areas to enjoy natural things. In particular, due to the success of Jeju Olle-gil, each provincial government is introducing new hiking courses to attract tourists. Actually, anyone can make their own hiking course, but many people don&amp;rsquo;t know. In my case, I have one in Seoul. Therefore, I would like to introduce my hiking course in this blog.</description>

Before starting my new career, I had worked for a big electronics company and worked on open source projects such as Mozilla, Gtk+, WebKit project since 2007. The job was stable and salary was also good. However, I decided to quit my job and started to get involved in the projects as a contributor.</description>

Building your own browser is the best way to find bugs and fix them. Now, I&amp;rsquo;d like to introduce how to build Chromium on your mac. I think that the latest code seems more stable(?) and provides more features.
This is a starting point to build Chromium on Mac OS X.

Issue1) IME Composition events should be handled consistently in all ports of WebKit.
=&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;This can&amp;rsquo;t be achieved as it depends on the platform IME system.</description>

      <description>I have been working on Korean Hangul composition issue in WebKitGtk. By the way, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that IME Composition events are handled inconsistently in each WebKit port.
According to W3C DOM Level 3 events,
 A browser should fire compositionstart, compositionupdate, and compositionend event during a composition. The textEvent event should be dispatched after a compositionend event if the composition has not been canceled. While a composition session is active, keyboard events should not be dispatched to the DOM (i.</description>

      <description>Fennec is a XUL application, like Firefox based on Mozilla Platform. Therefore, it can be debugged and modified with the Firefox debugging tools you are familiar with.
XUL applications consist of several XUL, JavaScript, and CSS files, which are archived in a Jar file. In the case of Fennec, it has two jar files in fennec/chrome/. en-US.jar which has localization information, chrome.jar which has Fennec front-end code.

Windows Mobile keeps the status of hardware keyboard in the registry as follows:
&amp;quot;HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Shell\\HasKeyboard&amp;quot; A software keyboard can pop-up if a device doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a hardware keyboard. However, in the case that the device has a slide-out keyboard, the value should be changed according to the status of the slide-out keyboard.</description>

      <description>When you finish building Fennec for Windows Mobile, you can ask &amp;ldquo;How can I install Fennec on my Windows Mobile handset?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Where is the installer?&amp;rdquo;
Fennec build system creates only a zip file in the path of &amp;ldquo;objdir/mobile/dist&amp;rdquo;.
You might install Fennec using this zip file. But, it is cumbersome. Fortunately, the Fennnec team has released Fennec for Windows Mobile as a cab install.

Doug Turner solved the test blocker of Fennec for Windows Mobile.
I was delight to hear the new because I had tried several times to run Fennec on my SAMSUNG i780 (called Mirage in Korea). I had failed to run Fennec.


Tooday, I tried to build Fennec for Windows Mobile from the trunk of Mozilla.
It is working well, but very slow on i780.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if this patch could be applied to the mainline.
Mozilla platform already supports the hildon framework so it is easy to add new things for Maemo if you wish.</description>

FODSEM(Free and Open Source Software Developer’s European Meeting) is a largest occasion for free/open source developers in Europe. It is relevant to various open source projects and it can be compared with OSCON(O’Reilly Open Source Convention) held in the US.

This occasion was held to celebrate Firefox3 release and talk about the future plan of Firefox3.1 and the current issues.
About 400 Mozilla peoples joined the summit coming from all over the World. They are involved in the various projects such as AMO(Add-ons), QA, Localization, Gecko, JavaScript, Mobile, UX, evangelist, messaging, SVG, MDC, and so on.</description>

      <description>The plan of Mobile Firefox was announced in October last year and the Mozilla community is now very busy to develop Mobile Firefox.
Fennec is the code name of Mobile Firefox, which is a desert fox. You may have seen a fennec in TV animation. The size of fennec is smaller than normal fox and it has big ears. So I think the name of Fennec seems to be suited well for Mobile Firefox.</description>

Some people call them native interface
I already posted a blog on device APIs
The Mozilla community started to discuss what the device APIs should be supported through the news group and Mozilla wiki.
Christopher added some information regarding the device APIs in the wiki.
So you can find on-going issues to support the device APIs. They are not confirmed, so you can suggest your idea &amp;amp; opinion to them.</description>

Other telecom operators also have provided mobile full browsing service, but the rate plan is very expensive. For example, SK telecom charges about 3072Won(3$) per 1MB for data transfer.
The full browser was provided by Infraware that is a Korean company.</description>

The sensor means a device that reads data from the user&amp;rsquo;s physical environment. By the way, I am interested in how to get data from the native interfaces via web browser.</description>

Goal
Provide mobile web application environment which can use native interfaces.
- It can make XUL add-ons &amp;amp; web applications use native interfaces
through JavaScript
Types of Native Interfaces
(Most of mobile platforms support APIs for easy of use for camera, GPS, contact, and etc..)
There are two types of native interface:</description>

http://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Patches
My colleague tried to apply the png patch to Mozilla and get a good result related to performance improvement.
As you know, we can build the libpng fixed point routines like the above patch.
(Use #define PNG_NO_FLOATING_POINT_SUPPORTED in mozilla/modules/libimg/png/mozpngconf.h )
In this case, he can get 8.6% performance improvement.
It&amp;rsquo;s great. I think this patch is valuable to use on Mobile Firefox.</description>

SVG is a standard technology to create vector graphics on the web and even can be embedded in HTML pages</description>

      <description>We are using Firefox browser that has been developed by Mozilla. As you may know, Firefox is based on the Mozilla application framework that provides a good way of supporting cross-platform for running applications.
However, supporting cross-platform has some weak points. The first weak point is performance, the second is that it can not utilize the native user interface.
Some web browsers are based on the Mozilla application framework with a native user interface.</description>

      <description>North Korea carried out its first nuclear bomb test on Monday (Oct. 9).
Actually, we had anticipated their first nuclear bomb test at the end of the year.
But, they committed the test quickly.
I think that it is a “flagrant and brazen” violation of international opinion.
Seoul has made every effort to maintain the peace of the Korean peninsula. Gaesong Industrial park and the Mt. Gumgang(Gumgansan) tour are good examples of the effort.</description>

      <description>The Web is an increasingly important resource in many aspects of life: education, employment, government, commerce, health care, recreation, and more.
Howerver it is very dangerous if these resources only can be accessible for a specific web browser.
As you know, Most of people use Internet Explorer as web browser in Korea.
Internet Explorer supports incompatible features such as ActiveX, Some of JavaScript.
The problem is that Many web sites support the features include the government web sites in Korea.</description>

      <description>PlayStation3 will be released at the end of this year. It seems the last hope of SONY. As you know, SONY has a problem with the profit decline. Actually, SONY adhered to the Trinitron TV that was the most popular analogue TV in 90s. As a result, they were late to join the DTV market: SONY did not invest LCD panel or PDP and so they was not able to make better digital TVs than other competitors.</description>

      <description>It has been 30 years since Apple was founded on 1 April 2006 (1976 - 2006). It was a long history than I expected compared to Microsoft. Apple is a computer manufacturer and MS is a software company. Two companies have helped each other and also have a competitive relationship. Two companies are developing different operating system, but MS is developing software for Mac. It is interesting that the first version of MS Excel was for Mac and Internet Explorer was the official web browser of Mac before releasing Safari.</description>

They are using the concept of tags. We can attach tag to pictures or bookmarks. Tag is like keyword that presents the meaning of something. Before, I only classify something to one category. Now, We can classify pictures or bookmarks to several category that using tags.</description>

It is thinner and lighter than I expected. Using an iPod is very easy for me because I already have used iTunes on my Mac. In addition, I have many mp3 files and video files in my iTunes music library. The problem is that I have to resize video files to move to iPod. Fortunately, iTunes can resize the video files, which have a large screen size, to play well on the iPod.</description>

Flash memory is one of memory you are using everyday in your mobile devices.
Almost memories on your PC lose data when the power is off. However, flash memory can maintain data though the power is off. You are already experienced that your mp3 player never loses music files.
What is Flash Memory?
Flash memory is non-volatile, which means that it does not need power to maintain the information stored in the chip.</description>
