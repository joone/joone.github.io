			<p>The Web is an increasingly important resource in many aspects of life: education, employment, government, commerce, health care, recreation, and more.<br>
Howerver it is very dangerous if these resources only can be accessible for a specific web browser.</p>
<p>As you know, Most of people use Internet Explorer as web browser in Korea.<br>
Internet Explorer supports incompatible features such as ActiveX, Some of JavaScript.<br>
The problem is that Many web sites support the features include the government web sites in Korea.</p>
<p>Actually, Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can use the Web. But It is more dangerous that web sites can be accessible for the specific web browser.</p>
<p>Now, Many linux &amp; Mac users can not use internet banking, shopping mall sites, steaming service. Because these features are only implemented using ActiveX technology.</p>
<p>Moreover, Many web sites still use table tag for making the frame of web site. Other web browser can not render the web pages like Internet Explorer. So instead of using table tag for framing web pages, we have to use CSS, XHTML for making web pages.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the market share of Firefox is increasing now. And many people realize the problem of web accessibility.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to browseing any web sites using any web browser.</p>
