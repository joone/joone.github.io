			<p>Ozone-Wayland is an Ozone implementation of Chromium, which allows to run <a href="http://crosswalk-project.org/">Crosswalk</a> and Chromium browser natively on Wayland without any X11 dependence[1].</p>
<p>I have been working on Ozone-Wayland recently. There were two releases since I was involved in the development. <a href="https://github.com/01org/ozone-wayland/tree/Milestone-Easter">In the latest release</a>, I contributed the virtual keyboard support to Ozone-Wayland. You can find how it works in the following video:</p>
<p>The ozone-wayland team has been focusing on graphics accelerations such as WebGL, Canvas 2D, Accelerated Compositing on Wayland. WebGL and Canvas 2D accelerations can be accelerated by <a href="https://github.com/01org/ozone-wayland/issues/29">off-screen Rendering</a> in GPU process. In the latest release, we started supporting multi-touch and virtual keyboard, which work fine on Tizen IVI as you can the above video.</p>
<p>What is Ozone?<br>
 <a href="http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/ozone">Ozone</a> is an abstraction layer used by Chromium browsers to separate out the different windowing systems and also abstract surface acceleration for Aura UI framework, input handling, event handling, and other UI-related matters[4]. Ozone-Wayland provides Wayland support for Ozone[2].</p>
