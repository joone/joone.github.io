			<p>After I read <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/gnomg/2012/01/27/apply-for-your-gnome-membership/">this blog post</a>, I applied for membership in the GNOME Foundation. Finally, my application was accepted last week. I think that my WebKitGtk+ contribution and GNOME Korea activities could count towards membership.</p>
<p>The main reason why I decided to become a GNOME foundation member is to let GNOME folks know about the GNOME Korea community(<a href="http://gnome.or.kr/">http://gnome.or.kr</a>). The GNOME Korea community started to translate for GNOME in 1998, and is mainly working on Korean translation(<a href="http://l10n.gnome.org/teams/ko/">http://l10n.gnome.org/teams/ko/</a>). Changwoo Ryu has led the Korean translation team since the early stages of GNOME. As a member of the GNOME Korea community, I organize GNOME Tech Talks every month to introduce various GNOME technologies to Korean developers and am also in charge of maintaining the GNOME Korea blog (<a href="http://gnome-kr.blogspot.com/">http://gnome-kr.blogspot.com/</a>).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really grateful to become a new GNOME foundation member. In particular, I’d like to thank Xan Lopez and Gustavo Noronha(kov) for helping me to become involved in WebKitGtk+ development. In the future, I will try to report on activities of the GNOME Korea community and my GNOME experiences through <a href="http://planet.gnome.org/">Planet GNOME</a> and here.</p>
