			<p>I&rsquo;m excited to share that the explainer for the <strong>Delayed Messages API</strong> has been published!</p>
<p>ðŸ“„ <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers/blob/main/DelayedMessages/explainer.md">Explainer on GitHub</a></p>
<p>This proposal introduces a new <strong>web performance API</strong> to help developers monitor <code>postMessage</code> events across windows, iframes, and web workers.</p>
<p>As you may know, web applications often use <code>postMessage</code> for communication between execution contexts. But these messages can sometimes be delayedâ€”stuck in the queue while the receiverâ€™s event loop is blocked by long-running tasks or overloaded with too many messages.</p>
<p>Such delays can make apps feel sluggish and unresponsive. And right now, itâ€™s difficult for developers to pinpoint exactly why these delays happenâ€”whether itâ€™s due to a busy thread, message queue congestion, or the overhead of serialization and deserialization.</p>
<p>The <strong>Delayed Messages API</strong> aims to solve this by exposing detailed timing metrics for <code>postMessage</code> eventsâ€”including queue wait time and blocking tasksâ€”so developers can identify performance bottlenecks and make targeted improvements.</p>
<p>The explainer outlines both the motivation and the initial API design.
