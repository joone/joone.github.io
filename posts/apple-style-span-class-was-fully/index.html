			<p>Finally, Apple-style-span class was fully removed from Blink(<a href="https://codereview.chromium.org/2685793002/">commit</a>).</p>
<p>Apple-style-span has not been produced since 2011: <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/1737/apple-style-span-is-gone">https://webkit.org/blog/1737/apple-style-span-is-gone</a>, but there were still some legacy code to handle Apple-style-span class because old WebKit engines has produced it, but now <a href="https://www.chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/461">the usage is quite low(&lt;=0.0001%)</a>. So, we decided to remove it from Blink at BlinkOn7. The code was executed whenever the users copy a text or run Editing APIs(document.execCommand) to keep the styles when pasting it. Other non-standard CSS classes(Apple-interchange-newline, Apple-converted-space, Apple-paste-as-quotation) will be also removed soon if possible.</p>
<p>Anyway, I feel that editing in Chromium is a bit faster :P</p>
