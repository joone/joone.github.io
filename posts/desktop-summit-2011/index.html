<p>It has been a week since I got back home from Cambridge. I had a day trip in London before leaving for Korea, which was very nice because I got the chance to look around the royal places, museums, and parks. In particular, <a href="http://instagr.am/p/KxTAH">I was so excited to find a TINTIN shop by chance</a>. :-)</p>
<p>Anyway, <a href="http://desktopsummit.org/">Desktop Summit 2011</a> was great: there were many great talks, workshops, BoFs, and parties as usual. It was good to meet <a href="http://planet.collabora.com/">my Collabora colleagues</a>, WebKitGtk+ maintainers(Kov, Xan, Martin, Alex, Philippe, Diego), <a href="http://blog.peremen.name/">a Korean KDE contributor(peremen)</a>, and some new people(Adrián, Debarshi,&hellip;). I even gave a talk of webkit-clutter. If I was asked to compare this summit to <a href="http://www.grancanariadesktopsummit.org/">the last one</a>, I can say two things: first, GNOME and KDE talks were not duplicated so I could attend <a href="https://desktopsummit.org/program/sessions/rekonq-webkit-browser-kde">a KDE talk about a WebKit Browser</a> and there were more common sessions GNOME and KDE folks could share together. Therefore, this conference seemed more like a true Desktop Summit. The next difference was that it’s very hard to find mobile related topics in this conference. I think that It was a big loss for the community that Nokia left MeeGo. Although Intel is trying to maintain the MeeGo Project, it seems like it&rsquo;s not easy to delivery MeeGo to the mobile market alone.</p>
<p>webkit-clutter talk</p>

<p>I gave a talk about <a href="http://blog.kov.eti.br/?p=139">webkit-clutter</a> in place of Kov because he had personal business to attend to. This talk was a part of <a href="https://desktopsummit.org/program/sessions/webkit-clutter-port-present-and-future-webkitgtk-status-and-roadmap-webkit2">the WebKit talk</a>: first, Martin explained the new features of <a href="http://webkitgtk.org/">WebKitGtk+</a> 1.4.0 and upcoming feature of the next version. Second, Alex introduced the current status of <a href="http://blog.kov.eti.br/?p=110">WebKit2Gtk+</a> and gave a demo of it, which showed us how to restart a flash plug-in without affecting browsing capability. That explains why we need the multiple process model in web browsing.  Finally. I introduced the webkit-clutter port: why the webkit-clutter port is needed, what we have done, and what features are coming. I will introduce more details about the WebKit talk in the next blog post.</p>

<p>Xan showed a demo of installing and running a web application in GNOME3.  He said “80% of the time people use the web so 80% of GNOME effort should go to the web”, I agree with him, we need to focus on web integration with GNOME more. Anyway, Xan seemed like a web evangelist during his talk.</p>
<p>Other interesting talks</p>

<li><a href="https://desktopsummit.org/program/sessions/gstreamer-10">GStreamer 1.0</a>:  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wim_Taymans">Wim</a> introduced the main changes of <a href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/">GStreamer</a> 1.0 such as managing memory, buffer metadata, and dynamic pipeline. You will be able to get more information from <a href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/conference/">the GStreamer conference</a> <a href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/conference/">l in Prague, Czech Republi</a>c</li>

<li><a href="https://desktopsummit.org/program/sessions/gtk-4-future-your-favorite-toolkit">GTK 4 - the future of your favorite toolkit</a>: Actually, nobody has started working on GTK4+, but the speakers showed a big picture of GTK+4  which will improve in areas of animations, effects, and transformations. For realizing this plan, Clutter will be used as a graphic backend, which allows GTK+ applications to use animation effects easily.</li>
<li><a href="https://desktopsummit.org/program/sessions/gnome-shell-version-%CF%80">GNOME Shell version π</a>: <a href="http://blog.fishsoup.net/">Owen Talyor</a> Introduced GNOME Shell 3.2 with some demos such as Google Account Integration, soft keyboard, and more extensions.</li>
<li><a href="https://desktopsummit.org/program/sessions/gnome-continent-starting-asia">GNOME a continent, starting from Asia</a>:  There was a introduction of how the GNOME Asia summit started, what it has done and what it will do. I wish to attend the next GNOME Asia Summit held in Hong Kong.</li>
<li><a href="https://desktopsummit.org/program/sessions/towards-multitouch-gnome-shell">Towards a multitouch gnome-shell</a>: Although it will take more time to see if X.org supports multi-touch officially, Carlos showed a demo of the multi-touch gnome shell. This seemed like the first step to touch based devices.</li>

<p>NateOn connection manager for Telepathy</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/0kwPZvIhVDbmBXjcZz4N3YRz8iMWtfLnGk6Jv7k6V-pRoKtP6tCIB25MXgUuGbz69ILF6iaidbDFijQt08znj-WH28SRtwkg52WjjCs52eR3iE67CFs" alt=""></p>
<p><a href="http://nateonweb.nate.com/download/messenger/linux/">NateOn is an instant messenger which is very popular in Korea</a>. As you can see the above picture, it supports the Linux version, but <a href="http://kldp.net/projects/nateon/">the project</a> has not been maintained well. The problem is that <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=617951">NateOn was removed from the Debian archive because it built with KDE3</a>.(<a href="http://changwoo-hacks.blogspot.com/2011/03/nateon.html">ChangWoo’s blog article</a>) As a result, Korean users can’t download NateOn from Debian repositories. Although there was a proposal to develop a NateOn connection manager for <a href="http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/wiki/">Telepathy</a> from <a href="http://gnome.or.kr/">the GNOME Korean community</a>, it was just an idea. Fortunately, I met a Telepathy contributor, Debarshi who is interested in this project. I shared all the information about NateOn with him so that he was able to start developing the connection manager. When it starts to work a bit, I will be able to join the project.</p>
<p>Currywurst</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/zKT1DWo3Ht0r3fyfswRqzCz8AiLXF-gZyHBjOobWFOP2_pX0rIuQ9g_2Kzs08AGz45NN-7pwMgqgwoJ3oiJcl2YuLfoaY9GRAQ47owk92_ETqJdqjRY" alt=""></p>
<p>I didn’t have a chance to go to any tourist attractions in Berlin this time, but I had Currywurst which is well-known Berlin food. It was good to have it with a beer.</p>
<p>Visiting the Cambridge office</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RAlWk3geM_jEcKi2SJ778fjGE11PRt88iK7iOafL30Lkmh7cTKI5OAnTIhQuotW192qQ8CNJoPJs7Ohokof0DNP57Xd-2toC_B00UDaAQSQA62ZtVLE" alt=""></p>
<p>After the Desktop Summit, I moved to Cambridge for visiting the company HQ office. It was very nice to meet people and work at the office. I had brought along some postcards of UNESCO World Heritage of Korea for a small gift as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-CziKUQLRAs11ZwCX_cBeaBd_b2P2thO6-B-BXN6nIQrXAidoJghgcQnjgidKGfvkeVeBiX-hVYh402Fiw_JyWxUuSsXKusDcUlT1ummPeRCkJ34rOA" alt=""></p>
<p>You can see them from the bulletin board when you visit the office.</p>
<p>There are many tourist attractions near the office, so I went to the Cambridge University Botanic Garden and the Fitzwilliam Museum during my stay. It was very nice, so I have shared some photos here.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yVQBBoYpGn6oWta3D3cPzRl2RpPb_Nk6-UMJjGMpE_nVsUuzu6nGxyDnlVoFb_bhOs6shsCm3fqtaJ1YbcETlWGfAcb4AWC1y-gMojAm36jM4eu-nI4" alt=""><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/iXDPlS-DiqqyR1t6yrC1iu4IjvX-is5yJ6B_5P7Lt-CvgcFRFFnVPgLIDE2CTPWI02c2bG3m03dXJF82zdrp95C2eqpMadOzBk3nzZK_OUMqe6oCb74" alt=""><br>
On the last evening, we had a team dinner in an Indian restaurant. Although British accent was a bit unfamiliar to me, I enjoyed the talks and the Tandoori chicken. Anyway, I’d like to thank everyone in the office for helping me stay and work well. Thanks!</p>
<p><img src="http://www.collabora.com/logos/collabora-logo-small.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Finally, I&rsquo;d also like to thank my employer, <a href="http://collabora.com/">Collabora</a> for sponsoring my trip to Berlin for Desktop Summit 2011. I hope to see everyone at the next Guadec in A Coruña, Spain.</p>
