			<p>Mitchell Baker, chair of the Mozilla foundation and Gen Kanai, Asia marketing manager, visited Korea to attend the <a href="http://www.oecdministerialseoul2008.org/en/programmee/speaker_view.html?id=81">OECD ministerial meeting</a> during June 17th ~ 18th and give talks in the <a href="http://webappscon.com/fwf/2008/english.html">Future of Global Web Technology</a> conference on June 19th.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, Mozilla had officially released Firefox3 in this period of time, so the Mozilla Korea Community hosted a Firefox Seoul party to celebrate the release of Firefox3. They also attended the party, so it made the event more exciting for the community.</p>
<p>Before the party, I had the opportunity to have dinner with Mitchell Baker and Gen Kanai. I heard about the story of how Mitchell started her career in IT and was involved in the Mozilla project. It was an awesome story. I think she is part of the history of the Web.</p>
<p><a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3233/2600070070_c3d0206568_m.jpg"><img src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3233/2600070070_c3d0206568_m.jpg" alt=""></a>I was also pleased to meet Gen, although we had not met each other,  because <a href="http://joone4u.blogspot.com/2008/02/open-source-in-asia.html">I had seen his talk in the Lift conference</a> and read <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/gen/">his blog</a>. So I felt like I was meeting people I was already acquainted with. In addition, he has already written about the Mozilla Korea Community activities and <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/gen/2007/02/27/the-cost-of-monoculture/">the unique situation of using ActiveX controls in Korea</a> in  his blog. So I&rsquo;d like to thank him for his efforts.</p>
<p>There were some events during the party. Firstly, we enjoyed <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbktEKwoS-E">an interesting video of introducing the new features of Firefox3</a> and some photos of the Mozilla Korea Community activities.<br>
<a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3172/2605495028_64f0427df9_m.jpg"><img src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3172/2605495028_64f0427df9_m.jpg" alt=""></a><br>
Secondly, we had a Q&amp;A time with Michell Baker. She kindly gave us answers about many questions regarding Mozilla/Firefox despite the late time and busy schedule. It left me wondering where she got her power &amp; passion.</p>
<p>As the chair of the Mozilla foundation, she has striven to make the people all over the world access the Web equally without any restrictions. So I think that those efforts make her more powerful and active.</p>
<p>Thanks, Mozilla for keeping the Web for everyone; I will also help Mozilla spread Firefox.</p>
