I have recently launched a new cartoon blog on the KLDP site, marking my first foray into cartoons.
Although I have been creating cartoons for my personal homepage for some time, I didn&rsquo;t do it regularly, and my homepage remained relatively obscure. Consequently, my cartoons did not gain much popularity or impact.

<p>I have recently launched a new cartoon blog on the KLDP site, marking my first foray into cartoons.</p>
<p>Although I have been creating cartoons for my personal homepage for some time, I didn&rsquo;t do it regularly, and my homepage remained relatively obscure. Consequently, my cartoons did not gain much popularity or impact.</p>
<p>KLDP is a website dedicated to open-source, free software, and Linux. Hence, the primary focus of my cartoons is on software.</p>
<p>I am looking to share my cartoons on this blog in English, as the original versions are only available in Korean.</p>
<p>I would greatly appreciate any advice and encouragement</p>
