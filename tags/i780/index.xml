      <description>I was told a very good news from Blassey blog.
Doug Turner solved the test blocker of Fennec for Windows Mobile.
I was delight to hear the new because I had tried several times to run Fennec on my SAMSUNG i780 (called Mirage in Korea). I had failed to run Fennec.
Tooday, I tried to build Fennec for Windows Mobile from the trunk of Mozilla.
It is working well, but very slow on i780.</description>
