      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m excited to share my recent contribution to the llama-recipes, a project used for fine-tuning Llama2.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on fine-tuning the Lamma model since its open-source release. Initially, I utilized the alpaca-lora project, which enabled fine-tuning Lamma using a consumer&amp;rsquo;s NVidia GPU. This was a significant advantage as it allowed me to develop my own version of ChatGpt. However, the LLM industry moves at a rapid pace: Meta released Lamma2 shortly after.</description>

      <description>History I fixed a caret color issue in WebKit in 2013, but I found out there was a regression, which made me work this issue again and finally fixed it. o/ It was a bit hard for me because I had not worked on WebKit since Chromium forked from the WebKit project in 2013.
The source code has been changed and I almost forgot how to deal with layout test errors.</description>
