      <description>I fixed a caret color issue in WebKit in 2013. I found out there was a regression, which made me work this issue again and finally fixed it. o/ It was a bit hard for me because I had not worked on WebKit since Chromium forked from the WebKit project in 2013.
The source code has been changed and I almost forgot how to deal with layout test errors. My WebKit debugging skill is also rusty.</description>
