      <description>It has been a week since I got back home from Cambridge. I had a day trip in London before leaving for Korea, which was very nice because I got the chance to look around the royal places, museums, and parks. In particular, I was so excited to find a TINTIN shop by chance. :-)
Anyway, Desktop Summit 2011 was great: there were many great talks, workshops, BoFs, and parties as usual.</description>
