      <description>Sometimes, we don&amp;rsquo;t know exact requirements or expect user behaviors while developing or fix something. I fixed the file-picker modal issue in Chromium for Linux last year. At that time, the reviewer and I thought that there would be no case to pop-up multiple file-pickers, but it happened since M55 when you follow the following steps:
 Enable &amp;ldquo;Ask where to save&amp;rdquo; in settings. Open 2 tabs of e.g.: https://sourceforge.net/projects/azureus/files/latest/download Wait for 2 downloader windows, and close/cancel/etc both Freeze or crash  Here is a video to reproduce the problem.</description>

      <title>Apple-style-span class was fully removed from Blink</title>

      <description>Finally, Apple-style-span class was fully removed from Blink(commit).
Apple-style-span has not been produced since 2011: https://webkit.org/blog/1737/apple-style-span-is-gone, but there were still some legacy code to handle Apple-style-span class because old WebKit engines has produced it, but now the usage is quite low(&amp;lt;=0.0001%). So, we decided to remove it from Blink at BlinkOn7. The code was executed whenever the users copy a text or run Editing APIs(document.execCommand) to keep the styles when pasting it.</description>
