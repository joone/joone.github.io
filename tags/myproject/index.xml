      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been developing the Loz project in my spare time for nearly a year. It&amp;rsquo;s now ready for others to use, so I&amp;rsquo;m excited to share the latest updates.

Support for Local LLM Initially, Loz only supported the OpenAI API. A friend inquired about integrating open-source LLMs like Llama2, which isn&amp;rsquo;t straightforward to set up on a user&amp;rsquo;s computer. I discovered a project called Ollama that simplifies the installation of various open-source LLMs with a single command.</description>

      <title>Loz, A Command-Line Interface Tool for ChatGPT</title>

      <description>When I first encountered ChatGPT, I thought it would be a good idea to use it to write GIT messages. I often spend a lot of time writing and updating GIT messages to explain my changes in a better and more concise way, but it is not always easy. So, I implemented a small CLI tool called Loz to write GIT messages in a GIT repository. It worked well, and some people started using it and contributing to my project.</description>

      <title>rust-animation project</title>

      <description>I had used the GNOME Clutter project in the past while working on Accelerated Compositing in the WebKit clutter port. During that time, I extended the existing Clutter Actor APIs and implemented my own Actor to support CSS 3D transforms, which worked well. I even managed to run some impressive CSS 3D animation demos in the WebKit Clutter port.
However, the Clutter project has lost its direction and is now almost deprecated, even though it is still used in GNOME Shell.</description>
