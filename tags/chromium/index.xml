      <description>Recently, I published a blog article about making Use Of Chrome&amp;rsquo;s Ozone-GBM Intel Graphics Support On The Linux Desktop. This is about using ChromeOS graphics stack for a regular Linux system. This article was also mentioned in Phoronix.
Originally, my old colleague started working on this a long time ago, but it has been broken since then. So I have been trying to enable ozone-gbm on a Linux system because this solution would be useful for embedded systems.</description>

      <description>I attended BlinkOn9 from April 18 to 19, 2019. Here is the official page: bit.ly/blinkon9-info, presentations, and Lightning Talks.
At this conference, I talked about acelerating graphics performance with ozone-gbm on Intel based Linux desktop systems: explained what kind of hardware accelerations have been applied to Intel -based Chromebook and how we can use them on a Linux desktop.
Here is a demo video on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY7X6vWD_wo</description>

      <description>Ozone-Wayland is an Ozone implementation of Chromium, which allows to run Crosswalk and Chromium browser natively on Wayland without any X11 dependence[1].
I have been working on Ozone-Wayland recently. There were two releases since I was involved in the development. In the latest release, I contributed the virtual keyboard support to Ozone-Wayland. You can find how it works in the following video:
The ozone-wayland team has been focusing on graphics accelerations such as WebGL, Canvas 2D, Accelerated Compositing on Wayland.</description>

      <description>Copyright © Chromium Project
Building your own browser is the best way to find bugs and fix them. Now, I&amp;rsquo;d like to introduce how to build Chromium on your mac. I think that the latest code seems more stable(?) and provides more features.
This is a starting point to build Chromium on Mac OS X.
http://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/MacBuildInstructions
Installing the depot-tools http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/install-gclient
$ svn co http://src.chromium.org/svn/trunk/tools/depot_tools
Add depot_tools to your PATH:</description>
