      <title>The WindowService2(?) of CrOS</title>

      <description>Recently, WS was replaced with WS2:
  1144255 window-service: removes mus_demo, test_wm, and some unnecessary deps
  Issue 865689 Remove window-service
  I ran mus_demo to test ozone-gbm, but now it&amp;rsquo;s gone. :-( So, I need to figure it out what is the difference between WS1 and WS2.
What is the Window Service of ChromeOS? Window Service is a kind of Window Compositor like Weston. It is a separate process from the browser process in CrOS.</description>

      <description>Recently, ChromeOS started to support Linux applications on ChomeOS. Google hasn&amp;rsquo;t allowed ChromeOS to run native applications due to security reason. Finally, they found a way to support Linux application through the container technology.
It is worth to read a discussion on CrOSVM on Hacker News because the original author joined the discussion. Here is the article about ChromeOS Linux container.
