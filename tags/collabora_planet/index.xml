      <description>It’s been almost 3 months since I started using a Nokia N9 as my secondary phone, which is a Linux based smart phone released by Nokia on October 2011. In this post, I will introduce what Nokia N9 is and how to use it in Korea, because it adopts an open source mobile platform which means that anyone can be involved with the project.
Nokia N9
Unfortunately, N9 is the first and last MeeGo phone, but it seems to be close to the Maemo platform, because it uses Qt as the UI framework and the Debian package system.</description>

      <title>Glad to become a new GNOME foundation member</title>

      <description>After I read this blog post, I applied for membership in the GNOME Foundation. Finally, my application was accepted last week. I think that my WebKitGtk+ contribution and GNOME Korea activities could count towards membership.
The main reason why I decided to become a GNOME foundation member is to let GNOME folks know about the GNOME Korea community(http://gnome.or.kr). The GNOME Korea community started to translate for GNOME in 1998, and is mainly working on Korean translation(http://l10n.</description>

      <description>During the WebKitGkt+ hackfest 2011, I applied Accelerated Compositing to WebKitGtk+ using Clutter so it started working like the webkit-clutter port. Finally, I was able to run the same demo in GtkLauncher as follows:
This is not upstreamed yet, but Imy patches are getting reviewed. Gustavo and Martin are helping me write more good patches. Thanks!
I think that this hackfest was done well. You can check more news about the WebKitGtk+ hackfest from other blog posts:</description>

      <description>(C) Mario Gustavo and I are attending the WebKitGtk+ hackfest 2011 which is held at the Igalia office in A Coruña, Spain like the last time. This is an annual event for WebKitGtk+ maintainers to work together at the same place.
We made a list of work items on the blackboard as usual on the first day. You can find these topics in the wiki. My major work item is to apply Accelerated Compositing implementation of the clutter port to WebKitGtk+.</description>

      <title>Talking about GNOME3</title>

      <description>I gave a talk about GNOME3 at Daum DevOn conference in Korea. Daum is a popular web portal site in Korea like Yahoo. They invited many developers &amp;amp; user communities to the conference, so the GNOME Korea community had a chance to introduce GNOME3 and the community to the attendees.
I was so glad to introduce GNOME3.2 and the infra technology like GTK+, Clutter, GStreamer, WebKitGtk+, Telepathy and GObject-Introspection. Here are the slides and some photos.</description>

      <description>Last Sunday, the 2nd of October, was the most memorable day in my
life. Because I was married on the same day 6 years ago and I became a father for the first time. Actually, the birth was scheduled for the 13th of October, but it seems that she was born 2 weeks earlier to celebrate our wedding anniversary. :-) She is a little bit smaller than other babies, but healthy and well.</description>

      <description>It has been a week since I got back home from Cambridge. I had a day trip in London before leaving for Korea, which was very nice because I got the chance to look around the royal places, museums, and parks. In particular, I was so excited to find a TINTIN shop by chance. :-)
Anyway, Desktop Summit 2011 was great: there were many great talks, workshops, BoFs, and parties as usual.</description>
