Since the Google Chrome team announced the new headless mode, the new headless mode has gradually supported the old headless features. This was one of the missing features.\nBut, what does disabling lazy loading actually mean?\nFirst, we need to understand what lazy loading is on the Web. Lazy loading is a technique that delays the loading of resources until they are needed. This can improve performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be loaded initially.\nFor example, when a webpage has numerous images, users may have to scroll down the page to view the images. In such cases, the browser can defer the loading of the unseen images by using loading=lazy attributes for images. See this demo: https://enviragallery.com/demo/lazy-loading-demo/ So, why should we disable lazy loading in headless mode? In headless mode, the image lazy loading becomes unnecessary because users want to get a fully loaded page in order to capture a screenshot or generate a pdf. This applies not only to image loading but also to any sub-resources like JavaScript, CSS, and iframes as follows:\n\u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;image.jpg\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;...\u0026#34; loading=\u0026#34;lazy\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;iframe src=\u0026#34;video-player.html\u0026#34; title=\u0026#34;...\u0026#34; loading=\u0026#34;lazy\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt; This change was applied to the main branch of headess_shell and old headless mode on Jan 18, 2023\nYou can find more details about it here:\nhttps://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/\u0026#43;/a4e84e7e99130c902d10209bb33903c110e359e7\nIf you wish to disable lazy loading in the new headless mode, make sure you are using the latest version of Chromium.\nHere are some additional details about lazy loading:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Lazy_loading https://web.dev/i18n/en/browser-level-image-lazy-loading/ ","date":"May 7, 2023","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/post/headless-chrome_hu163f7469596d0cd40fbb7021521419b4_18606_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"img-fluid w-100 rounded\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/headless-chrome_hu163f7469596d0cd40fbb7021521419b4_18606_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_2.webp'\"\u003e\n \n \n \n\n","permalink":"/blog/headless-disable-lazy-loading/","tags":["chromium","headless"],"title":"The new Headless mode now supports disabling lazy loading"},{"categories":null,"contents":"I had used the GNOME Clutter project in the past while working on Accelerated Compositing in the WebKit clutter port. During that time, I extended the existing Clutter Actor APIs and implemented my own Actor to support CSS 3D transforms, which worked well. I even managed to run some impressive CSS 3D animation demos in the WebKit Clutter port.\nHowever, the Clutter project has lost its direction and is now almost deprecated, even though it is still used in GNOME Shell.\nDespite this, I had always envisioned maintaining a project similar to Clutter. As a result, I personally worked on a C++ implementation of a scene graph engine using OpenGL and even created a Rust implementation.\nOne day, while searching for similar projects on the Rust package site (crates.io), I discovered that someone had taken the name I wanted for my project, but the owner had not yet started the project. As a result, I decided to create a Rust crate on crates.io and open my code in github.\nIt took some time to develop my Rust implementation to be more API-style, but the experience was much more interesting than I had anticipated, and I really enjoyed programming in Rust and publishing my project using the Cargo tool.\nOnce I had opened my code and created a crate on Rust crate site, I felt a greater sense of responsibility, even if nobody ended up using my project. Consequently, I continued to update my project and, in terms of code quality and functionality, the current code is much better than when it was first released. Here are the major features of rust-animation:\nAnimation with easing functions This library essentially enables the rendering of a rectangle with a specified color or texture image on the viewport. Furthermore, it also offers support for animations, utilizing a range of easing functions, including:\nEasingFunction::EaseIn, EasingFunction::EaseInCubic, EasingFunction::EaseInOut, EasingFunction::EaseInOutCubic, EasingFunction::EaseInOutQuad, EasingFunction::EaseInOutQuart, EasingFunction::EaseInOutQuint, EasingFunction::EaseInQuad, EasingFunction::EaseInQuart, EasingFunction::EaseInQuint, EasingFunction::EaseOut, EasingFunction::EaseOutCubic, EasingFunction::EaseOutQuad, EasingFunction::EaseOutQuart, EasingFunction::EaseOutQuint, EasingFunction::Linear, EasingFunction::Step Flex UI The support for Flex UI is fantastic, as someone has already implemented it for Rust projects. I simply added this crate to my project, and it works perfectly. In fact, I was able to implement the above demo in just 30 minutes. o/\nEvent handling rust-animation offers support for the EventHandler trait to enable event handling in rust-animation applications. Essentially, it works like callback functions, allowing users to receive event signals from rust-animation.\npub struct ActorEvent { name: String, } impl ActorEvent { pub fn new() -\u0026gt; Self { ActorEvent { name: \u0026#34;actor_event\u0026#34;.to_string() } } } impl EventHandler for ActorEvent { fn key_focus_in(\u0026amp;mut self, actor: \u0026amp;mut Actor) { println!(\u0026#34;key_focus_in: {} {}\u0026#34;, self.name, actor.name); actor.apply_scale_animation(1.0, 1.1, 0.3, EasingFunction::EaseInOut); } fn key_focus_out(\u0026amp;mut self, actor: \u0026amp;mut Actor) { println!(\u0026#34;key_focus_out: {} {}\u0026#34;, self.name, actor.name); actor.scale_x = 1.0; actor.scale_y = 1.0; } fn key_down(\u0026amp;mut self, key: usize, actor: \u0026amp;mut Actor) { println!(\u0026#34;key_down: {} {} {}\u0026#34;, self.name, key, actor.name); if key == 262 { // right cursor actor.select_next_sub_actor(); } else if key == 263 { // left cursor actor.select_prev_sub_actor(); } } } I am currently working on adding additional event handler methods.\nUser-defined layout In addition to Flex UI, rust-animation offers the ActorLayout trait as a means of implementing custom layouts.\npub struct ActorLayout { name: String, cur_x: i32, } impl ActorLayout { pub fn new() -\u0026gt; Self { ActorLayout { name: \u0026#34;actor_layout\u0026#34;.to_string(), cur_x: 0 } } } When rust-animation requires an update to the layout, it calls layout_sub_actor, which then enables the user to update the locations of the child elements as follows:\nimpl Layout for ActorLayout { fn layout_sub_actors(\u0026amp;mut self, sub_actor_list: \u0026amp;mut Vec\u0026lt;Actor\u0026gt;) { println!(\u0026#34;layout_sub_layer {}\u0026#34;, self.name); let mut index : i32 = 0; for sub_actor in sub_actor_list.iter_mut() { self.cur_x += sub_actor.width as i32; sub_actor.x = index % 5 * IMAGE_WIDTH as i32; let col = index / 5; sub_actor.y = col * IMAGE_HEIGHT as i32; index +=1; } } } Currently, the most pressing missing feature is support for text rendering. Although there are various crates available to support text rendering, I would like to opt for a native Rust implementation, such as rusttype.\nHappy Hacking!\n","date":"December 5, 2021","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://github.com/joone/rust-animation/blob/main/examples/easing_functions.gif?raw=true\" alt=\"\" class=\"img-fluid w-100 rounded\" height=\"\" width=\"650\"\u003e\n","permalink":"/blog/rust-animation/","tags":["Rust","MyProject"],"title":"rust-animation project"},{"categories":null,"contents":"History I fixed a caret color issue in WebKit in 2013, but I found out there was a regression, which made me work this issue again and finally fixed it. o/ It was a bit hard for me because I had not worked on WebKit since Chromium forked from the WebKit project in 2013.\nThe source code has been changed and I almost forgot how to deal with layout test errors.

Eventually, a Google engineer implemented proxy support for each BrowseContext and merged his patch to upstream. https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/\u0026#43;/2226298\nDespite of this proxy support, the createIncognitoBrowserContext function within Puppeteer remained unchanged. So I recently made a change to Puppeteer that allows developers to set proxy settings for each BrowserContext: https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/pull/7516\nHow to set a proxy for indivisual browse context We can now set a diffrent proxy for each indivisual BrowseContext at runtime.\n\u0026#34;use strict\u0026#34;; const puppeteer = require(\u0026#34;puppeteer\u0026#34;); (async () =\u0026gt; { const browser = await puppeteer.launch(); const context = await browser.createIncognitoBrowserContext( {proxyServer: \u0026#34;http://yourproxy.server\u0026#34;} ); const page = await context.newPage(); await page.authenticate({ username: \u0026#34;your_id\u0026#34;, password: \u0026#34;your_password\u0026#34; }); await page.goto(\u0026#34;https://google.com\u0026#34;); console.log(await page.content()); await browser.close(); })(); Bofore, we was only able to apply a global proxy setting for all all BrowserContexts.\nconst browser = await puppeteer.launch({ args: [ `--proxy-server=proxy-server.your_proxy.server:8001`, \u0026#34;--proxy-bypass-list=*\u0026#34;, ], }); const page = await browser.newPage(); await page.authenticate({ username: \u0026#34;your_id\u0026#34;, password: \u0026#34;your_passwd\u0026#34;, }); await page.goto(\u0026#34;http://www.google.com\u0026#34;); console.log(await page.content()); await browser.close(); For more details on the API, see the Puppeteer documentation: https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.browsercontextoptions\n","date":"August 22, 2021","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n","permalink":"/blog/proxy-support-puppeteer/","tags":["puppeteer"],"title":"Enhancing Puppeteer with Proxy Support"},{"categories":["chromeos"],"contents":"Recently, WS was replaced with WS2:\n1144255 window-service: removes mus_demo, test_wm, and some unnecessary deps\nIssue 865689 Remove window-service\nI ran mus_demo to test ozone-gbm, but now it\u0026rsquo;s gone. :-( So, I need to figure it out what is the difference between WS1 and WS2.\nWhat is the Window Service of ChromeOS? Window Service is a kind of Window Compositor like Weston. It is a separate process from the browser process in CrOS. Some of CrOS features are part of the browser process, but those features will be a separate process using the WindowService.\nFor more details, see https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/services/ws/README.md\n\u0026ldquo;Clients establish a connection to the WindowService by configuring Aura with a mode of MUS. See aura::Env::Mode for details. The WindowService provides a way for one client to embed another client in a specific window (application composition). Embedding establishes a connection to a new client and provides the embedded client with a window to use. See the mojom for more details. For example, on Chrome OS, Ash uses the WindowService to enable separate processes, such as the tap_visualizer, to connect to the WindowService. The tap_visualizer is a client of the WindowService. The tap_visualizer uses the WindowService to create and manage windows, receive events, and ultimately draw to the screen (using Viz). This is mostly seamless to the tap_visualizer. The tap_visualizer configures Views to use Mus, which results in Views and Aura, using the WindowService.\u0026rdquo;\nCrOS is now becoming more like a regular desktop.

So, while opening a file-picker, the users could control the main window. Sometimes, it caused mis-behaviors such as we were able to send an email while attaching a file.\nThere was already a bug and it seemed easy to fix it, but, it took 2 years to fully fix the problem.\nThe root cause is as follows:\nChromium for Linux uses GtkFileChooserDialog to open a file-picker, but it is not modal to the X11 host window because GtkFileChooserDialog can be modal only to the parent GtkWindow. So I tried to allow the X11 host window to disable input event handling to make a file-picker modal: Here is the details:\nOpening a file-picker DisableEventListening() disables event listening for the host window using aura::ScopedWindowTargeter, which allows to temporarily replace the event-targeter with ui::NullEventTargeter. It returns a scope handle that is used to call |destroy_callback| when closing the file-picker.\nclass ScopedHandle {\npublic:\nexplicit ScopedHandle(const base::Closure\u0026amp; destroy_callback);\n~ScopedHandle();\nvoid CancelCallback();\nprivate:\nbase::Closure destroy_callback_;\nDISALLOW_COPY_AND_ASSIGN(ScopedHandle);\n};\nIn addition, we also set another destroy callback(OnFilePickerDestroy) to the GtkFileChooserDialog that can be called when the file-picker is closed.\nClose the file-picker As you can see, OnFilePickerDestroy deletes scoped_handle.\nvoid OnFilePickerDestroy(views::DesktopWindowTreeHostX11::ScopedHandle*\nscoped_handle) {\ndelete scoped_handle;\n}\nThen, |destroy_callback| of ScopedHandle below is automatically called.\nvoid DesktopWindowTreeHostX11::EnableEventListening() {\nDCHECK(modal_dialog_xid_);\nmodal_dialog_xid_ = 0;\ntargeter_for_modal_.reset();\n}\nYou can find more details and discussion at here.\nThe first change list was reverted due to the UI freezing problem that happens when the users open a file-picker from a child window of the X11 host window. The second change list finally fixed this issue(BUG 408481, 579408).

There were many new things I learned about these holidays, so I’d like to share them with you.\nMany Koreans know about Halloween because the young Korean people who had studied in the US started bringing Halloween customs back to South Korea and enjoying Halloween there since the 2000s and the majority of kindergartens have a Halloween costume party these days, but Halloween is still not commonly celebrated in Korea, so it’s very hard to find a person wearing a Halloween costume on the streets on Halloween.\nI didn’t know that Halloween started in the US at first. From reading Wikipedia, I learned that Irish immigrants brought their Halloween into the new land and then it has been developed into what we see today. Actually, I didn’t know Halloween is such a big holiday like Christmas, until I saw every big market start to sell big pumpkins at the end of September. Moreover, a Korean also suggested to me that I visit a pumpkin farm near Portland together. I didn’t think I would buy a pumpkin at that time. Anyway, I took my family there in early October.\nI was surprised to see many pumpkins in the field. The pumpkin farm was very fun to walk around. I got on a small train with my daughter lead by a tractor. There were many kinds of farm animals such as ponies, pigs, cows, sheep, and chickens, so my daughter saw them very closely, which made her excited. Every family, including the Korean family, bought pumpkins. Finally, I bought a pumpkin for my daughter and it still rolls around on the living room floor.\nOn Halloween, my daughter wore a vampire dress and went out with me to get candies and chocolates. I saw many children and their parents wore various costumes walking around. They really enjoyed the day, even some who were adults, so I considered wearing a costume for the next Halloween day. My daughter is also prepared for next Halloween: I already bought her another costume for 50% off!\nAfter Halloween, I noticed that many people started getting ready for Thanksgiving. I I became aware that, like Halloween, Thanksgiving Day also started in the U.S. I thought every Western person enjoyed Thanksgiving day, similar to how Korean people sometimes think all western people are American.\nFortunately, an older Korean couple who have been living in the U.S. for many years invited me to their Thanksgiving dinner. If it wasn\u0026rsquo;t for my friendly daughter, I might not have had the chance to participate in a Thanksgiving feast. While my wife was grocery shopping with my daughter near our apartment one day, she smiled at an elderly Korean couple. They started chatting, and my wife found out that they had lived in the U.S. for many years. They ended up inviting me to their house for Thanksgiving dinner. They prepared a turkey, sweet potatoes, cranberry jam and kimchi and soybean stew. The turkey was really good. I heard that it takes a lot of time to cook a turkey, from marinating to roasting. I would like to thank the couple and hope everything is great with them.\nChristmas Day in the U.S. is a bit different although it is also a holiday in Korea. It seemed that every family really enjoyed Christmas day: I saw many houses decked out with lights for Christmas and my colleagues brought Christmas cookies to the office. I also decorated a Christmas tree with ornaments and lights for my daughter, which was my first time to have a Christmas tree at home. My tree is a fake one, but many families seem to buy a real tree. As you may know, it’s very hard to find a real Christmas tree and houses decked with lights in Korea. Usually, churches and department stores are decked with lights, but not private homes. Decorating a Christmas tree is also not common, even for Christians. I also attended the Portland Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Pioneer Square, which is one of my best memories of Portland. An interesting thing was that nobody around me had attended this ceremony, which for me was like many Seoul citizens never having gone up to the observation deck of the 63 building in Yeouido.\nThrough experiencing these holidays in Oregon for the first time, I realized that we just know superficial things about how other people live in their countries, and I have resolved to try to learn as much as possible about America and Americans while I live in the U.S.\n","date":"December 30, 2013","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/post/chrome_graphics_ozone_arch-458x225_huc10e897e5bf2f6907589761d46b219dd_55810_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"img-fluid w-100 rounded\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/chrome_graphics_ozone_arch-458x225_huc10e897e5bf2f6907589761d46b219dd_55810_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\n \n \n \n\n","permalink":"/blog/what-i-learned-about-american-holidays/","tags":null,"title":"What I learned about American holidays"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Can you believe that a Kpop song reached no.1 on iTunes in 31 countries?, even though this Kpop song is not an English song, but a Korean song that is called “Gangnam style” by PSY. Actually, nobody expected that this song could become a great hit wordwide, but this song has been spread all over the world very quickly due to Youtube. In this article, I am going to talk about why “Gangnam style” became more popular than other typical Kpop idol songs.\nRecently, Kpop has been popular in Asia and has had some fan groups in the western countries, but Kpop itself refers to songs for the younger generation, which have been performed by girl and boy groups so far. However, Psy’s “Gangnam style” showed a different side of Kpop songs because he didn’t imitate the pop idols and created his own style that nobody had performed before.\nPsy is so unique, even in Korea. He has kept his own character since he debuted in 2001, which is a cheap and comic image. This means that he enjoys performing in his own style.\nDuring the time from his debut until now, he has released 5 albums and has 6 number 1 hit songs in Korea. His music is always cheerful and makes us excited because he has produced his songs by himself in order to pursue his own style. The interesting thing is that his style has gained in popularity because his songs give comfort to people who are suffering from a long recession.\nWhy did “Gangnam style” became popular? The contract with Justin Bieber’s manager, Scooter Braun played an important role, but without Youtube, all things might have never happened. Currently, Psy’s Gangnam style has racked up over 400 million views on YouTube and becoming the most-liked video in the site’s history. Actually, he didn’t make any effort to make people know about his song except by making the comic music video. I think Youtube changed the way of promoting music, which means that there are no barriers to find music. A few years ago, one Indian song was popular in Korea because of its comic style. Psy’s song is the same case.\nPsy’s success is not by chance, because he has been developing his own music style for 10 years. “Gangnam style” is just the first of his songs to show his character and music to the world. I’m sure again that creating one’s own style is always better than imitating others in many areas. Furthermore, anyone can be a star through Youtube if they have any special talents which other stars haven’t shown.\nReferences:\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/arts/music/interview-psy-the-artist-behind-gangnam-style.html?_r=0 http://edition.cnn.com/2012/10/01/world/asia/psy-gangnam-style-charts/index.html http://askakorean.blogspot.com/2012/10/aak-music-gangnam-style-by-psy.html ","date":"November 29, 2012","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/post/chrome_graphics_ozone_arch-458x225_huc10e897e5bf2f6907589761d46b219dd_55810_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"img-fluid w-100 rounded\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/chrome_graphics_ozone_arch-458x225_huc10e897e5bf2f6907589761d46b219dd_55810_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\n \n \n \n\n","permalink":"/blog/why-gangnam-style-became-more-popular/","tags":null,"title":"Why Gangnam style became more popular than other typical Kpop idol songs"},{"categories":null,"contents":"It’s been almost 3 months since I started using a Nokia N9 as my secondary phone, which is a Linux based smart phone released by Nokia on October 2011. In this post, I will introduce what Nokia N9 is and how to use it in Korea, because it adopts an open source mobile platform which means that anyone can be involved with the project.\nNokia N9\nUnfortunately, N9 is the first and last MeeGo phone, but it seems to be close to the Maemo platform, because it uses Qt as the UI framework and the Debian package system. In addition, N9 is the first mobile phone to embrace WebKit2 which supports the multi-process model, so you can build WebKit for Nokia N9.\nKorean Support\n**\nActually, I had been having trouble with using N9 because it doesn’t support Korean language officially, so there is no Korean keyboard and Korean fonts by default. Fortunately, a Nokia Korean engineer developed a Hangul keyboard and its debian package with Korean fonts. I think he might have worked on this in his free time. I am very grateful for his efforts. You can find the source code of the Korean keyboard from Gitorious.\nN9 User Group in Korea\nIn addition, there is a small N9 user group in Korea, so I got some information on how to register N9 with Korean wireless telecommunication operators such as SK Telecom and KT. Interestingly, the saleswoman in the phone shop was able to set it up without asking any questions while registering it, which shows that N9 UI is very intuitive to use.\nDeveloper Support**\nIt’s quite easy to install developer packages in N9. You can run an X-terminal and browse the directories to check which system libraries are installed. Furthermore, if you want to develop a QT application, you can even install the QT SDK and developer tools in your Linux, Windows, and Mac.\nInstalling Gtk+\nGtk+ had been used as the default UI widget until Maemo Fremantle, but N9 started using Qt by default. Fortunately, a hacker did the porting of Gtk\u0026#43; for Maemo Fremantle to N9, so, you can install the same Gtk2.14.7\u0026#43; on N9.\nWhat about the next model of N9?\nI think that Nokia didn’t give up their generic Linux platform although they chose the Window phone platform instead of MeeGo. I expect that Nokia will continue on releasing Qt based smart phones in the future because a true Linux platform will be their hidden key someday.\nAnyway, if you want to make your own mobile platform or test its component software, N9 would be a good test bed for you.\n","date":"March 26, 2012","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/post/chrome_graphics_ozone_arch-458x225_huc10e897e5bf2f6907589761d46b219dd_55810_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"img-fluid w-100 rounded\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/chrome_graphics_ozone_arch-458x225_huc10e897e5bf2f6907589761d46b219dd_55810_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\n \n \n \n\n","permalink":"/blog/its-been-almost-3-months-since-i/","tags":["Nokia","collabora_planet","N9","MeeGo"],"title":"Using Nokia N9 in Korea"},{"categories":null,"contents":"After I read this blog post, I applied for membership in the GNOME Foundation.

In particular, I was so excited to find a TINTIN shop by chance. :-)\nAnyway, Desktop Summit 2011 was great: there were many great talks, workshops, BoFs, and parties as usual. It was good to meet my Collabora colleagues, WebKitGtk+ maintainers(Kov, Xan, Martin, Alex, Philippe, Diego), a Korean KDE contributor(peremen), and some new people(Adrián, Debarshi,\u0026hellip;). I even gave a talk of webkit-clutter. If I was asked to compare this summit to the last one, I can say two things: first, GNOME and KDE talks were not duplicated so I could attend a KDE talk about a WebKit Browser and there were more common sessions GNOME and KDE folks could share together. Therefore, this conference seemed more like a true Desktop Summit. The next difference was that it’s very hard to find mobile related topics in this conference. I think that It was a big loss for the community that Nokia left MeeGo. Although Intel is trying to maintain the MeeGo Project, it seems like it\u0026rsquo;s not easy to delivery MeeGo to the mobile market alone.\nwebkit-clutter talk\nPhoto by Adrián\nI gave a talk about webkit-clutter in place of Kov because he had personal business to attend to. This talk was a part of the WebKit talk: first, Martin explained the new features of WebKitGtk\u0026#43; 1.4.0 and upcoming feature of the next version. Second, Alex introduced the current status of WebKit2Gtk\u0026#43; and gave a demo of it, which showed us how to restart a flash plug-in without affecting browsing capability. That explains why we need the multiple process model in web browsing. Finally. I introduced the webkit-clutter port: why the webkit-clutter port is needed, what we have done, and what features are coming. I will introduce more details about the WebKit talk in the next blog post.\nBlending the web and the desktop\nXan showed a demo of installing and running a web application in GNOME3. He said “80% of the time people use the web so 80% of GNOME effort should go to the web”, I agree with him, we need to focus on web integration with GNOME more. Anyway, Xan seemed like a web evangelist during his talk.\nOther interesting talks\nGStreamer 1.0: Wim introduced the main changes of GStreamer 1.0 such as managing memory, buffer metadata, and dynamic pipeline. You will be able to get more information from the GStreamer conference l in Prague, Czech Republic GTK 4 - the future of your favorite toolkit: Actually, nobody has started working on GTK4+, but the speakers showed a big picture of GTK+4 which will improve in areas of animations, effects, and transformations. For realizing this plan, Clutter will be used as a graphic backend, which allows GTK+ applications to use animation effects easily. GNOME Shell version π: Owen Talyor Introduced GNOME Shell 3.2 with some demos such as Google Account Integration, soft keyboard, and more extensions. GNOME a continent, starting from Asia: There was a introduction of how the GNOME Asia summit started, what it has done and what it will do. I wish to attend the next GNOME Asia Summit held in Hong Kong. Towards a multitouch gnome-shell: Although it will take more time to see if X.org supports multi-touch officially, Carlos showed a demo of the multi-touch gnome shell. This seemed like the first step to touch based devices. NateOn connection manager for Telepathy\nNateOn is an instant messenger which is very popular in Korea. As you can see the above picture, it supports the Linux version, but the project has not been maintained well. The problem is that NateOn was removed from the Debian archive because it built with KDE3.(ChangWoo’s blog article) As a result, Korean users can’t download NateOn from Debian repositories. Although there was a proposal to develop a NateOn connection manager for Telepathy from the GNOME Korean community, it was just an idea. Fortunately, I met a Telepathy contributor, Debarshi who is interested in this project. I shared all the information about NateOn with him so that he was able to start developing the connection manager. When it starts to work a bit, I will be able to join the project.\nCurrywurst\nI didn’t have a chance to go to any tourist attractions in Berlin this time, but I had Currywurst which is well-known Berlin food. It was good to have it with a beer.\nVisiting the Cambridge office\nAfter the Desktop Summit, I moved to Cambridge for visiting the company HQ office. It was very nice to meet people and work at the office. I had brought along some postcards of UNESCO World Heritage of Korea for a small gift as follows:\nYou can see them from the bulletin board when you visit the office.\nThere are many tourist attractions near the office, so I went to the Cambridge University Botanic Garden and the Fitzwilliam Museum during my stay. It was very nice, so I have shared some photos here.\nOn the last evening, we had a team dinner in an Indian restaurant. Although British accent was a bit unfamiliar to me, I enjoyed the talks and the Tandoori chicken. Anyway, I’d like to thank everyone in the office for helping me stay and work well. Thanks!\nFinally, I\u0026rsquo;d also like to thank my employer, Collabora for sponsoring my trip to Berlin for Desktop Summit 2011. I hope to see everyone at the next Guadec in A Coruña, Spain.\n","date":"August 27, 2011","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/post/chrome_graphics_ozone_arch-458x225_huc10e897e5bf2f6907589761d46b219dd_55810_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"img-fluid w-100 rounded\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/chrome_graphics_ozone_arch-458x225_huc10e897e5bf2f6907589761d46b219dd_55810_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\n \n \n \n\n","permalink":"/blog/desktop-summit-2011/","tags":["Desktop Summit","collabora_planet","GNOME"],"title":"Desktop Summit 2011"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Recently, I spent some time implementing the viewport meta tags and tiled backing store for WebKitGtk+, which are the mobile features of the WebKit engine. In this post, I’m going to tell you more about the mobile features of the WebKit engine and how to enable each feature when you build WebKitGtk+.\nFirst of all, the WebKit engine is particularly strong in the mobile area, because it is lighter and faster than other browser engines and has been verified by the success of Safari on the iPhone. Due to this reason, most mobile devices have adopted the WebKit engine to offer their own web browser: Nokia Symbian, Google Android, HP WebOS, and Samsung Bada are all using WebKit based browsers.\nAdditionally, WebKit is an open source project. Naturally, all source code is open to the public, but there is no obligation for manufacturers to open their browser code, because the WebKit engine uses the LGPL, so it allows a browser executable file to just link with the WebKit engine dynamically. It means that the browser can be a different file independent from the WebKit library. Because of this reason, the mobile features of Safari on the iPhone need not be open to the public and subsequently it has been hard to access the mobile features. Fortunately, other phone manufacturers have participated in the WebKit project and are developing mobile features within the community. Currently, Nokia, RIM, Samsung, Motorola and Erricson have participated in the WebKit project. In addition, the open source companies Collabora and Igalia have worked on WebKit for a long time.\nRecently, some mobile features already have been applied to the WebKit engine such as the tiled backing store, touch events, and viewport meta tags. Since these features are a little complicated to understand in terms of the name, I will explain them including the other mobile features supported by WebKit in more details.\nFast Mobile Scrolling Tiled Backing Store Viewport Meta Tags Frameset Flattening Touch Events Fast Mobile Scrolling\n\u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5182/5597019959_50c470de37.jpg\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; You can see a fixed background image(Smile Icon) when you even scroll the web page as you can see in the above picture. This can be possible if a web page has elements which have the CSS background-attachment property. In this case, WebKit carries out a slow repaint in order to avoid rendering artifacts. However, scrolling a web page with a fixed background image causes noticeable delays on mobile devices. It means that WebKit tries not to update fixed elements every time to scroll fast because it is hard to display a fixed element while scrolling fast.\n\u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5305/5597587400_3768649994.jpg\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\nIn order to avoid this problem, we can make scrolling faster if we ignore the CSS property \u0026ldquo;background-attachment: fixed\u0026rdquo; by enabling the fast mobile scrolling option as you can see in the left picture (i.e. the fixed background can be scrollable on WebKitGtk+ with the fast mobile scrolling build option).\nTo enable the fast mobile scrolling:\nBuild WebKitGtk+ with the fast mobile scrolling option: $WebKit/Tools/Scripts/build-webkit --gtk --fast-mobile-scrolling Tiled Backing Store\nWhen I tried to use Safari on the iPhone, I was impressed by the fact that the scrolling web pages were very fast. This is possible because Safari caches the content of the web page as bitmaps in memory, and the cached bitmaps we\u0026rsquo;ve seen are just painted on the screen without sending paint calls to WebCore when we scroll a web page. These bitmaps are created and deleted on-demand as the viewport moves over the web page. We call them the “tiled backing store.”\nThe tiled backing store was applied to QtWebKit by Nokia engineers. They applied this feature to WebCore, so it can be shared by other ports. In the case of WebKitGtk, Code Aurora engineers submitted an initial patch, I have updated the patch to use only Cairo API by removing GTK\u0026#43; dependency. This would allow the WinCairo and Efl port to use the updated patch for enabling the tiled backing store.\nTo enable the tiled backing store:\n1 ) Build WebKitGtk+ with the tiled backing store option as follows:\n$ WebKit/Tools/Scripts/build-webkit --gtk --tiled-backing-store Set the tiled backing store setting to TRUE through WebKitWebSettings as follows: WebKitWebSettings \\*settings = webkit\\_web\\_view\\_get\\_settings(webView); g\\_object\\_set(G\\_OBJECT(settings), \u0026#34;enable-tiled-backing-store\u0026#34;, TRUE, NULL); Viewport Meta Tags\n\u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5292/5460755418_d6d667e6e1_o.png\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5252/5481285644_9a0d39c365_o.png\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; Apple introduced the full browsing feature for the first time when they released the iPhone. Until then, the mobile phone was not usable to browse web pages made for desktop due to the small screen size. To overcome this limitation, Safari on the iPhone zooms web pages out automatically to fit to the screen like in the above picture(left).\nFor this, Safari on the iPhone assumes that web pages have 980px width by default. When Safari loads a web page, it scales down the web page by a factor of 0.32 (320/980) to fit to the width of the screen in the case of iPhone 3G. But, the problem is that all pages are not displayed to fit to 980px width. For example, mobile web pages can be displayed well with 320px or 480px. the Google Search page is displayed on the iPhone like the right picture because the Google search page is required to have the less width compared to 980px.\nTo solve this problem, Apple defined the viewport meta tags to allow web browsers to support desktop web page and mobile web page effectively. Actually, this is not a web standard, but most mobile web browsers have adopted this feature and WebKit also supports it.\nLet’s take a look at the viewport meta tag in more detail. The viewport meta tags can be used to set the width, height and initial scale factor of the viewport. Although most web pages don’t have viewport meta tags, mobile browsers which have 320 px screen width can apply initial values to web pages as follows:\n\u0026lt;meta name = \u0026#34;viewport\u0026#34; content = \u0026#34;width = 980\u0026#34; initial-scale = \u0026#34;0.32\u0026#34;\u0026gt; In the case of mobile pages, you need to set the viewport meta tags as follows:\n\u0026lt;meta name=\u0026#34;viewport\u0026#34; content=\u0026#34;user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, width=device-width\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; As you can see each property, web pages can not be scaled up/down; even user scaling is turned off. This is because the mobile web pages are actually written for the small screen.\nFor more information on the viewport meta tags, refer to the Safari reference library.\nFrameset Flattening\n\u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5263/5597820692_2085d92442.jpg\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\nThere are some web pages that have their own scrollable area with the scroll bars like the above page. We call this \u0026ldquo;sub frame.\u0026rdquo; On touch devices, the problem is that it is desirable not to have any scrollable sub frame of the web page because the user could confuse with sometimes scrolling sub frames and scrolling the web page itself at other times because it is very hard for the user to understand what “sub frame” is. For this reason, iframes and framesets are hardly usable on touch devices.\n\u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5262/5597236979_36bdab6dc0.jpg\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\nHowever, if you enable the frameset flattening features when building Webkit, all the frames can be one scrollable page as you can see the above figure.\nTo enable the Fameset flattening:\nWebKitWebSettings \\*settings = webkit\\_web\\_view\\_get\\_settings(webView); g\\_object\\_set(G\\_OBJECT(settings), \u0026#34;enable-frame-flattening\u0026#34;, TRUE, NULL); Touch events\nSupporting multi-touch has become popular since iPhone introduced it. Now, all smart phones support multi-touch. Using multi-touch allows the users to use more than two fingers to interact with applications on their smart phone. For example, you can use a piano or guitar applications using your 5 fingers.\nHowever, using multi-touch is not only possible for native applications, but also for web pages. Since WebKit supports touch events as DOM events, web developers can deal with touch events using JavaScript. There are 4 kinds of touch events: touchstart, touchmove, touchend, and touchcancel. Unfortunately, WebKitGtk+ doesn\u0026rsquo;t support the touch events yet. So if you want to test the touch events , running QtWebKit or mobile Safari would be good. For more information on how to use the touch events, refer to the Safari reference library.\nFinally, I’d like to let you know there are more mobile features I didn’t introduce here, such as intelligent zoom, kinetic scrolling, zooming animation, and etc. WebKit doesn’t support them by itself, but the hosting applications can implement these kind of features, because these features are likely to depend on the platform. However, when these features are added to WebKitGtk+, I will talk about them in more detail.\nReferences\nQtWebKit goes Mobile https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/Mobile%20Features%20Talk ","date":"May 21, 2011","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/post/chrome_graphics_ozone_arch-458x225_huc10e897e5bf2f6907589761d46b219dd_55810_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"img-fluid w-100 rounded\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/chrome_graphics_ozone_arch-458x225_huc10e897e5bf2f6907589761d46b219dd_55810_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\n \n \n \n\n","permalink":"/blog/webkit-mobile-features/","tags":["Webkit","mobile"],"title":"WebKit Mobile Features"},{"categories":null,"contents":"I attended the WebKit Contributors meeting which was held by Apple, April 24~25 2011 near Apple Campus in Cupertino, California. This is the annual meeting for WebKit reviewers and committers. They come together to discuss the current issues of WebKit and hack the code in the meeting. In this post, I am going to introduce you to what we talk about in the WebKit meeting.\nAs you know, WebKit is the hottest open source project these days, because most mobile phones use the WebKit engine and additionally Chrome and Safari also are based on WebKit. In addition, the WebKit engine is used for mobile platforms such as HP WebOS and RIM Playbook. Therefore, Apple and Google as well as other big electronics companies like Nokia, RIM, Samung, Motorola have joined the WebKit project. As you might already know, Collabora, the company I work for, has contributed to WebKitGtk\u0026#43; with Igalia.\n\u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5266/5685808656_31d294c4bb.jpg\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\nOn the first day, we made the tracks and sessions instantly in the morning. Actually, there were many talks and hackathons proposed, but we chose our favorite items by voting. Although I was not able to attend all sessions, I will introduce some of them briefly.\nFirst, I\u0026rsquo;d like to talk about WebKit2. Actually, Apple announced the WebKit2 project to support a multiple process model in WebKit like Chrome browser in the previous year. Other ports like Qt and Gtk+ are also trying to support the WebKit2 model. In the WebKit2 session, we discussed many issues, but I listed up some of the most important ones which readers might be interested in as follows:\n- Using C API, is this a great choice?\n- Support for Out-of-process plugin\n- Code sharing between WebKit1 and WebKit2\n- DRT rewritten\n- Support for threaded model\n- Low-level communication code is very specific to the platform. It needs an abstract model for communication between the web process and ui process.\n- It is difficult to follow accessibility implementation on a Mac.\nThe next interesting session was about hardware acceleration. We discussed the current issues of hardware acceleration in each port. In particular, Google’s effort on 2D acceleration is quite interesting to me. Actually, 2D acceleration is a very challenging task because I have seen many trials of improving 2D graphics rendering through OpenGL or OpenVG. However, the performance was not faster than CPU. Interestingly, Google seemed to try to accelerate 2D graphics by 3D graphics in the WebKit itself. But, all 2D drawings are not dependent on GPU, only the specific 2D drawing primitives are rendered by GPU. So they are currently profiling 2D drawing primitives rendered by GPU to see which 2D graphics primitives are really accelerated by GPU. If this hybrid model is successful, we will be able to apply it to other ports.\nIn other sessions, we talked about reducing the build systems in WebKit. Currently, we have 8 build systems for each WebKit port. So, when we add new source files, sometimes we forget to add the files to all of the build systems, which causes build breaks. Accordingly, CMake and GYP were proposed for unifying the build systems. However, each port just follows its development environment, so it seems like it would be hard to unify each current build system into one. I think that WebKitGtk+ can move to CMake, but I’m not sure if the GNOME guys like it. In addition, one of our core contributors, Eric introduced how his team designed and implemented HTML5 parser. Actually, the existing parser was so complex as written in one source file which was the longest file in WebKit, so he told us that it took several months to understand the parser code. So he divided the parsing functionality into several classes such as HTMLToken, HTMLTokenizer, HTMLTreeBuilder, HTMLDocumentParser, and others.\n\u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5227/5655590159_d44b646aff_m.jpg\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\nAdditionally, there was a party on the first day held by the Google Chrome Team. I met the reviewers who have reviewed my patches. I was pleased to meet them directly; it was like meeting old friends. It made me feel more connected to the community.\nThese days, the companies in which the WebKit contributors are involved are competing with each other, but as I saw at the meeting, the contributors are working together to develop a better web engine. For instance, I learned that Google is trying to overtake Apple with Android and Chrome, but they still work closely to develop the features of the HTML5/CSS3 standard. In addition, Nokia and RIM’s reviewers, like Kenneth and tonikitoo always review Samsung’s patches. I think this is an example of the power of open source.\nAnyway, I hope to talk more details about the next meeting.

It has been downloaded more than 57 million times since its release from all over the world. The release has been successful so far, but it seems not to be easy to compete the other browsers as much as before. In this post, I am going to talk about new features of Firefox4 , the reason why using Firefox is important, and the task of remaining competitive as a community supported browser.\nNew features of Firefox4\nFirst, let’s take a look at the new features of Firefox4[1].\nApp Tabs \u0026amp; Panorama\nHow many tabs are you opening when using Firefox? In my case, I open more than 10 tabs, so it is very difficult to find the page I want to see easily. App Tabs \u0026amp; Panorama help you organize so many tabs. In more detail, App tabs are a kind of tab, but these tabs are located in the left side of the tab area, which just display its icon without the title. So it allows users to place more tabs in the tab area. The difference compared to normal tabs is that these tabs can be shown after the browser restarts. If you open Facebook, Twitter, and GMail as App Tabs, you don’t need to open those web pages again. In the case of Panorama, relevant tabs can be group together as you see the above figure. It helps the user find a tab more easily. In addition, you can move tabs among groups by drag \u0026amp; drop.\nWebGL\nWebGL brings 3D graphics to Firefox, which allows for developers to create 3D games and 3D UI for the Web. This link introduces several WebGL demos running on Firefox4, so you can imagine how the Web would change in the future.\nIn addition, Firefox4 introduces a lot of new technologies for Web developer:\nJägerMonkey JavaScript engine : This is a new JavaScript Engine that replaced TraceMonkey, which allows JavaScript to run faster. WebM Support: WebM is an open source, free royalties video codec open by Google. It allows people to author and distribute their own video without paying any royalties. HTML5 Parser: This allows the browser to parse HTML content in the same way, even if the content has errors. IndexDB: This is the Web standard for database. More File APIs: It allows to upload files more easily. Audio API: It allows to process audio streams for mixing and equalizing. Multi Touch: Multi touch is supported by Windows7. Web Console: This allows developers to check the content loading status from the console window. For detailed information on the new features, take a look at the following page:\nhttp://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/features/\nWhy Firefox?\nDo you remember the dark age of the Web? After the browser war[2] between Internet Explorer and Netscape was over in the 1990s, Internet explorer came to have more than 95% of the market share by 2002. As a result, nobody had cared about innovation in web browsers; until 2006 there was only one new version of Internet Explorer since version 6.0 was released in 2001. IT experts call this period of time the dark age of the Web, because there was no alternative browser for Internet Explorer. As a result, many web sites were dependent on Microsoft’s proprietary technology, like ActiveX control. Firefox was created to give back the Web to people by breaking the dark age like Luke Skywalker in Star Wars.\nNow, nobody dominates the Web because Mozilla has been doing well to develop the Web using open technology and in the standard way by HTML5, CSS3, SVG, free codec, etc. This means that there should be no barriers to see Web contents from any browser on any platform. However, there are still threats from big companies. They could control the Web in their own way if they surpass the other browsers. ActiveX control issue in Korea is a well known example. Therefore, we have to be interested in spreading Firefox and keeping the Open Web.[3]\nFuture of Firefox\nOpen competition makes the Web innovate faster than before. Actually, Firefox has a unique position in the browser market. It is an open source project and has lead to innovate the Web technology. However, Google Chrome also strongly has lead the Web innovation, which supports the multiple process model and the Web technology based add-ons. Additionally, it is an open source project and their development process is open like Firefox, so anyone can be involved the development. In the mobile market, the situation is worse. Apple doesn’t allow users to run Firefox on the iOS because Firefox can be an application platform itself. Another problem is that Firefox for Android is not popular yet.\nWell, how does Mozilla overcome this situation? Mozilla is trying to move the development focus from platform to product. In addition, they are preparing the Mozilla2 project which is a future platform for Firefox. It allows us to open each web page and add-on using a separate process. In my opinion, Mozilla should release Firefox for iPhone based on WebKit, because offering the same experience is more important than being addicted to the Mozilla platform.\nFirefox is not just a web browser but provides a way to see the world and meet people. If we access the Web through decentralized tools like Firefox, nobody can control the Web, allowing everyone to use the Web equally without any restrictions.\nReferences\n[1] http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/features/\n[2] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars#The_first_browser_war\n[3] http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2009/09/16/describing-the-open-web/\n","date":"April 22, 2011","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/post/chrome_graphics_ozone_arch-458x225_huc10e897e5bf2f6907589761d46b219dd_55810_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"img-fluid w-100 rounded\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/chrome_graphics_ozone_arch-458x225_huc10e897e5bf2f6907589761d46b219dd_55810_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\n \n \n \n\n","permalink":"/blog/firefox4-future-of-web_22/","tags":["firefox"],"title":"Firefox4 \u0026 the future of the Web"},{"categories":null,"contents":"When did you start using a PC? In my case, I started to use computers when I was in university. At that time, it was very difficult for general users to use a computer, because we had to memorize the commands and the directory path, which an executable file is located in. Even using a mouse was optional to use PCs. However, the computing environment has changed rapidly since Windows and the Web were introduced in the 1990s. These days, even a 2 years old baby is able to use a smart device like the iPad.\nOur PC usage has also changed rapidly. For example, installing softwares was always required to run them a few years ago, but these days, you may deal with most things on a web browser. If you close the browser, it may mean you are not using your PC anymore. As the Web technologies develop, the Web provides more services that we didn’t expect before. For example, we watch movies, music videos, and even TV on our browsers. In addition, we send and read emails using the web browser on any PC. Even if you use Google Docs, you can edit documents, slides, and spread sheets. Although it is missing many features such as animation effects, clip arts, etc, compared to MS Office, it is simple to use, and offers unique features such as collaborative editing in real-time. We may be living in the middle of the change from the desktop to the Web, similar to move from the text-based user interfaces like DOS to the GUIs like Mac OS and Windows.\nInterestingly, there is a hidden side to this change. Actually, Microsoft has dominated the desktop through Windows and Office. However, Google has been trying to encourage people to use the Web more. Search \u0026amp; Ads are their main business, but they have been offering various web services such as GMail, Google Docs, Calendar, and Youtube to lure people away from the desktop. Now, nobody stops this change because even Microsoft has also adopted this trend. As Microsoft opened the desktop age instead of IBM, Google is also trying to open an era of the web desktop.\nIf this is true, how does Google lead the change? As you know, Google is a web service company, but they launched the Chrome browser and Chrome OS in 2009. Actually, Google has sponsored the Firefox project for a long time. But now, they are developing their own browser and operating system like Windows. Moreover, they are investing a lot of engineering resources in order to innovate the Web technology. As a result, the Web seems to work more like the desktop in terms of introducing more desktop features such as dealing with multimedia, accessing hardware like GPS and cameras, working offline, etc. However, Google can be evil if they want to be, because they are gathering all information, even your private data, so we should keep our eyes on Google not to be evil, although the informal corporate motto of Google is “Don’t be evil”[1].\nYou are in the middle of the switch to a new desktop environment. I expect that many people will get benefits through this change because it makes people use PCs more easily and helps people get out of the pain of maintaining their PC. Also, it would give more business opportunities to new companies and developers.\nWhat should we do in this change? Just use the Web using the latest version of the web browser such as Firefox4 or Internet Explorer 9, which will come out this year. In addition, you need to acquaint yourself with famous web services such as Facebook, Flickr, Twitter, Youtube, Google Docs, etc. Because, if we have to follow the change, it would be better to lead it. If so, you may also have the opportunity to change your surroundings at your position through this exciting transition.\nReference\n[1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don\u0026amp;rsquo;t_be_evil\n","date":"March 2, 2011","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/post/chrome_graphics_ozone_arch-458x225_huc10e897e5bf2f6907589761d46b219dd_55810_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"img-fluid w-100 rounded\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/chrome_graphics_ozone_arch-458x225_huc10e897e5bf2f6907589761d46b219dd_55810_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\n \n \n \n\n","permalink":"/blog/age-of-web-browser-is-coming/","tags":["Web Browser"],"title":"The age of the web browser is coming"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5050/5235372842_8c4236d7b1.jpg\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;WebKitGTK\u0026#43; hackfest, day 0\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\n(c) 2010 Diegoe\nI attended the WebKitGtk\u0026#43; Hackfest held in the Igalia Office, located in Coruña, Spain, in this month. It was a great opportunity for me to meet the WebKitGtk+maintainers directly. This hackfest was sponsored by Collabora and Igalia. The Igalia office was very nice; it can be compared to the Google office in terms of the atmosphere. There were free snacks, beverage and game consoles in the office. Moreover, we had buffet lunch everyday. I\u0026rsquo;d like to give thanks to Collabora and Igalia for sponsoring the hackfest and the GNOME foundation for sponsoring my trip to Coruña.\nDuring the hackfest, we concentrated on hacking WebKitGtk+ to fix bugs and implement new features, only stopping to sleep and eat . Of course , we also made time for a city tour in Courña for a quater of a day.\nGtk+ and libSoup maintainers also attended the hackfest to support WebKitGtk+ maintainers, because WebKitGtk+ depends on those libraries. Moreover, embracing Gtk+3 needs Gtk+ maintainers\u0026rsquo; help to keep the pace with Gtk+3 changes. Also, an Epiphany browser maintainer also joined the hackfest to fix Epiphany bugs together with the WebKitGtk+ maintainers.\n\u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5089/5248952165_d92543f7a8.jpg\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;WebKitGTK\u0026#43; 2010 Hackfest\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\n(CC) 2010 Mario\nOn the first day, we listed up all work items on the chalkboard (as you can see in the above picture). When we finished each item, we rewarded ourselves with Super Mario BGM. :-) You can see the performance video as follows:\nMartin finished a task! YEAH! from diegoe on Vimeo.\nDuring the hackfest, I worked on viewport meta tags support and some missing features in the DRT test in WebKitGtk+. In addition, I improved the webkit cache model feature. In particular, I was pleased to finish the viewport meta tags patch.

They are famous trails in Korea to hike in the rural areas to enjoy natural things. In particular, due to the success of Jeju Olle-gil, each provincial government is introducing new hiking courses to attract tourists. Actually, anyone can make their own hiking course, but many people don\u0026rsquo;t know. In my case, I have one in Seoul. Therefore, I would like to introduce my hiking course in this blog.\nIt has been 7~8 years since I started to hike this way. I have hiked this way with some of my friends. Most of them have been satisfied with my course , because it offers a good view of Gyeongbok-Geung (Palace) and historical sites. Also, there are good cafes, restaurants, and museums, parks around this course, even including two mountains.\nThis course starts from Sajik park near Gyeongbok-gong station on Seoul Subway Line 3. The overall course is as follows:\nSajik Park(사직공원) =\u0026gt; Inwang-san(인왕산) =\u0026gt; Bukak-san(북악산) =\u0026gt; Samcheong-dong gil(삼청동길) =\u0026gt; Insa-dong(인사동)\nThis is just my own personal course, so you can make your own course depending on your preference or time allowance. Now, let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at each point.\nThe start point is Sajik Park, which is not a famous place now, but it was an important area in the Joseon dynasty. The purpose of Sajik Park was to hold a memorial ceremony for the ground and the five grains(rice, millet, beans, wheat and barnyard millet) ,which is the basis of stabilizing the dynasty. However, the Japanese Empire tore down the annexes and made this area into the park that it is today.\nThe next point is Inwang-san, which doesn\u0026rsquo;t seems high, but it\u0026rsquo;s covered with rocks, so you need to wear hiking boots. When you go up to the Inwang-san peak, you can see a complete view of Seoul including Seoul Tower and every mountain surrounding Seoul, even Incheon Airport if the weather is very clear. Also, there is a sad historic episode about an empress of the Joseon dynasty which is connected with Inwang-san. Her name was Empress Inhyeon(인현왕후)[2], a wife of SukJong (the 19th Emperor of the Joseon dynasty). She lost her position of empress due to strife. And then, she went to the peak of Inwang-san wearing white clothes and made a deep bow in the direction of the King every morning for 3(?) years. Fortunately, she became the empress again, but she died soon after without having had any children.\nBefore moving to the next point, you can have a break time in the cafe between Inwang-san and the entrance of Bukaksan near Changeui-mun(창의문). This cafe offers various types of coffee produced from famous areas of coffee bean production[5]. It would be as good as taking a break and talking with your friends.\nIf you want to go to the top of Bukaksan[3], you should prepare your resident registration card , driver\u0026rsquo;s license or passport (if you are a foreigner) due to the security of the Blue House. Actually, Bukaksan was not allowed to be entered for a long time since guerrillas from North Korea attempted to raid the Blue House to kill President Park JeongHee in 1969. As a result, the road to the mountain was closed for about 38 years. For this reason, development of this area has been limited for a long time. Therefore, you may doubt if you are in Seoul during your hike up to the top of Bukaksan, because you can only see green mountains and many detached houses.\nActually, Seoul was not always such a big city like this, it used to be a fortress capital city during the Joseon dynasty. Therefore, you can still find several gates in Jong-ro district. Unfortunately, many parts of the city wall and some gates were destroyed in the Japanese occupation and the Korean war. Some parts of the city wall are left on Inwang-san and Bukaksan. In addition, you can find a secret gate over the top of Bukaksan. It is called \u0026ldquo;Sukjeong-mun(숙정문)\u0026rdquo;.\nThere are two ways from Sukjeong-mun. One is for Seongbuk-dong gil, the other is Samcheong-dong gil. Now, I’d like to introduce the Samcheong-dong gil course, because it is close to Insandong-gil. However, if you take the direction of Samcheong-dong gil, it takes more time to hike down the mountain, so you can enjoy hiking more in the forest of Bukaksan.\nSamcheong-dong gil is one of the most beautiful streets in Seoul. There are many art shops, art galleries, cafes, museums, and restaurants. Actually, this area is a bit expensive, but the atmosphere and quality of food actually are quite good, so it would be a good choice for a nice meal with your closest friends. Before introducing some of them, I wonder whether you have heard about a Korean proverb, “금강산도 식후경”. It means that eating comes first in any situation so it would be good to drop by a restaurant first.\nMost of the restaurants here are a bit expensive and for special occasions, but Samcheong-dong Sujebi[6] is cheap and simple. According to Wikipedia, “Sujebi is a Korean traditional soup consisting of dough flakes roughly torn by hand, with various vegetables”. It also tells that Korean people began to eat Sujebi from early Goryo period, but my grandmother told me that Sujebi became common during the Korean war due to the significant rice shortage. At that time, the U.S. army gave wheat flour to Korean people as a form of food assistance. Many Koreans reluctantly had to have flour-based foods including Sujebi (because rice is the staple food of the Korean people). Due to this reason, it is very hard to find Sujebi restaurants these days. Anyway, this restaurant seems to be as old as Sujebi. Nevertheless, some bloggers complain the taste was not as good as it was once, but it is still one of the Korean dishes you must taste.\nAfter the meal, looking around the shops in Samcheong-dong is also good, in particular for women. If you have enough time, I recommend that you visit the Owl Museum[7] and the Tibet Museum[8]. Those museums are very unique because they are managed by private owners, so you can feel a different atmosphere compared to public museums.\nThe owl museum only specializes in owls, so you can find paintings, craftworks, and toys about owls. In the case of the Tibet museum, there are various things about Buddhist art, folkcrafts, clothes, photos and so on about Tibet. Although Tibet has been occupied by China since 1950, we are still able to see their unique culture. Before visiting those museums, you need to check up locations because both museums are located in side streets. Also, you have to make sure that the museums are open when you want to go.\nThe last point on my course is Insa-dong gil. Actually, Insa-dong gil is too famous to introduce here. Therefore, I would only like to introduce a traditional Korean teahouse in Insa-dong. As you know, Insadong-gil is famous for its traditional teahouses. Unfortunately, traditional alcohol pubs are increasing these days. Therefore, finding real traditional teahouses is getting harder in Insa-dong.\nThe above picture shows the interior of a teahouse I found by chance. Actually, I tried to find Kyungin Art Gallery because the gallery also offers Korean tea. Instead, I found a neat teahouse because I took a wrong side street. The teahouse is a real Hanok (Korean traditional house) and offers all kinds of equipment such as pottery and trays. In addition, the hostess is very kind so you can feel like being not a customer but a guest in this house.\nIn conclusion, making your own hiking course is not difficult. Just try to remember what streets, cafes, and restaurants you’ve preferred, and link all points with some stories such as historical episodes or your memories. And then if you share the course with your friends, your course will be rich with even more stories and attractions.\nReferences\n[1] Welcome to Jeju Olle website, http://www.jejuolle.org:8080/eng/\n[2] Empress Inhyeon(인현왕후), http://bit.ly/9FsgLk\n[3] Welcome to Bukaksan, http://www.bukak.or.kr\n[4] Seoul’s best walking trails http://www.koreaherald.com/lifestyle/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20100624000575\n[5] Club Espresso http://place.daum.net/place/Top.do?confirmid=9544927\n[6] Sujebi, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sujebi\n[7] The owl museum http://www.owlmuseum.co.kr/\n[8] The Tibet museum http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet_Museum_(South_Korea)\n","date":"November 14, 2010","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/post/chrome_graphics_ozone_arch-458x225_huc10e897e5bf2f6907589761d46b219dd_55810_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"img-fluid w-100 rounded\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/chrome_graphics_ozone_arch-458x225_huc10e897e5bf2f6907589761d46b219dd_55810_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\n \n \n \n\n","permalink":"/blog/my-favorite-hiking-course-in-seoul/","tags":["hiking","seoul"],"title":"My favorite hiking course in Seoul"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4031/5080322907_35683248ca.jpg\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s already been almost 4 months since I started a new career as an open source developer. Before starting my new career, I had worked for a big electronics company and worked on open source projects such as Mozilla, Gtk+, WebKit project since 2007. The job was stable and salary was also good. However, I decided to quit my job and started to get involved in the projects as a contributor. So, I\u0026rsquo;d like to introduce why open source is important for developers and the reasons why I participate in open source projects.\nWhat is open source?\nOpen source is a method of developing software. According to Wikipedia, \u0026ldquo;Open source describes practices in production and development that promote access to the end product\u0026rsquo;s source materials\u0026rdquo;. It means that anyone can access the source code of open source software. In addition, it should allow anyone to modify the source code and distribute it to anyone. Linux and Firefox are representative results of open source. Therefore, if you find some problems and have any proposals, you can modify the source code and submit the code to the maintainers. If your code makes sense, it could be merged into the open source software. If so, many people could use the software you contributed. Isn\u0026rsquo;t this amazing ?\nWhy people start open source projects\nThere are various reasons why people start open source projects. Most of these projects don\u0026rsquo;t have a big plan. They just start the project for meeting their needs. Some people start their projects just for fun. For example, Linus Tovalds, the creator of Linux kernel, just started Linux kernel project for fun during a long winter vacation when he was a university student. Of course, there was a small motivation. The Unix workstation machine was very expensive, so he had to go to the university to use it. Therefore, he wanted a Unix-compatible operating system to be run on his own 386 PC. After that, many people joined his small project. Currently, Linux kernel has been used for running digital TVs, Android phones, and other embedded devices. Although there are some open source projects that are started by companies for strategic reasons, most open source projects are started for trivial reasons.\nWhy developers should join open source projects\nFirst, you can improve your development skills in terms of reading the code and getting reviewed by other open source developers. In the case of Linux kernel, it supports various types of computer architecture, and the source code has been highly optimized for a long time. In addition, many open source software have been verified in terms of being included in commercial software.\nSecond, you can learn the latest high technology, because open source projects are always open for new technology. So, anyone can improve the funtionalities of open source software and suggest new features. In my case, I fixed Korean Hangul typing problem in WebKit, a browser engine, used for Safari and Chrome browser.\nThird, you can experience development process of software product because the big open source products: Linux kernel, Firefox, and OpenOffice, have a similar life cycle and organization like commercial software such as Microsoft Windows and Office. For instance, an open source project also requires individuals in various roles such as developer, tester, graphic designer, technical evangelist , educator and so on. In addition, most decisions about the project makes through mailing list, or IRC. If you have contributed for many years and have a good reputation, you can have a bigger say in the project. Finally, you can make friends with open source people from all over the world. There are various nationalities and ethnicities in the community. Some people are students, some are older. Nevertheless, they can share their thoughts and ideas for the same goal. For the above reasons, I strongly recommend that you participate in the open source projects even if you are not a software programmer.\nWhy I participate in open source projects.\nActually, I am an experienced programmer. I have more than 12 years of software development experience. However, I just spent my most of my development career for working on proprietary software. Fortunately, I met good open source people in the open source community and learned how to be involved in open source projects. In addition, I was able to work on open source software and had the chance to work together with the community in my previous company. It was a valuable experience because I learned how to write good quality software in terms of code review and code reading. Also, I could contribute my abilities and effort to open source projects for the public interest.\nCurrently, I am working on the WebKit, GNOME, Mozilla projects as a full-time open source developer. Although I am not making money working on these projects, I\u0026rsquo;m enjoying the life of an open source developer for the time being . Of course, there are ways of making money working on open source projects. In the future, when I have more experience with open source development, I will try to start my own open source project just for fun.\n","date":"October 12, 2010","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/post/chrome_graphics_ozone_arch-458x225_huc10e897e5bf2f6907589761d46b219dd_55810_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"img-fluid w-100 rounded\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/chrome_graphics_ozone_arch-458x225_huc10e897e5bf2f6907589761d46b219dd_55810_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\n \n \n \n\n","permalink":"/blog/why-i-participate-in-open-source/","tags":["OpenSource"],"title":"Why I participate in open source project"},{"categories":["Chromium"],"contents":"\u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_vr2B2ySFJkY/TF0anmRCrOI/AAAAAAAAAQI/BqU1d_Zqg74/s320/200px-Chromium_Logo.png\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\nCopyright © Chromium Project\nBuilding your own browser is the best way to find bugs and fix them.

Currently, before the textInput event is dispatched, DOM has been already mutated during a composition. Therefore, If there is to be a textInput event, first, the composition text is removed. And then, if the textEvent is not cancelled, the browser inserts the composition text again. It seems not efficient.\u0026quot;\nIssue3) While a composition session is active, keyboard events should not be dispatched to the DOM.\n=\u0026gt; In relation to keyboard events, WebKit has fired key events during a composition for a long time. Therefore, It can\u0026rsquo;t stop to fire key events in order to avoid site break.\nAs a result, they agreed that the DOM Level 3 event model for input composition does not match the requirements of actual web content as I have worried. Therefore, in order to avoid the confusion among web developers, the DOM Level3 events spec needs to introduce the reason why each browser handles keyboard events in different ways.\n","date":"August 4, 2010","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/post/chrome_graphics_ozone_arch-458x225_huc10e897e5bf2f6907589761d46b219dd_55810_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"img-fluid w-100 rounded\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/chrome_graphics_ozone_arch-458x225_huc10e897e5bf2f6907589761d46b219dd_55810_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\n \n \n \n\n","permalink":"/blog/feedbacks-from-communities-on-handling/","tags":["Webkit","W3C","IME"],"title":"Feedbacks from the communities on the key events handling in WebKit"},{"categories":null,"contents":"I have been working on Korean Hangul composition issue in WebKitGtk.

While a composition session is active, keyboard events should not be dispatched to the DOM (i.e., the text composition system \u0026ldquo;swallows\u0026rdquo; the keyboard events), and only compositionupdate events may be dispatched to indicate the composition process. However, all WebKit ports handle composition \u0026amp; textEvent events in inconsistent ways. Even keyboard events are still dispatched to the DOM during a composition.\nTherefore, it is necessary to fix the problems as follows:\nIME Composition events should be handled consistently in all WebKit ports.

I am so happy to contribute to Mozilla. Here is the detail what the problem was fixed:\nWindows Mobile keeps the status of hardware keyboard in the registry as follows:\n\u0026#34;HKEY\\_CURRENT\\_USER\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Shell\\\\HasKeyboard\u0026#34; A software keyboard can pop-up if a device doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a hardware keyboard. However, in the case that the device has a slide-out keyboard, the value should be changed according to the status of the slide-out keyboard.\nFor example:\nWhen the keyboard does not slide out, the HasKeyboard value has to be \u0026ldquo;0\u0026rdquo; Whenthe keyboard slides out, the HasKeyboard value has to be \u0026ldquo;1\u0026rdquo; However, the above registry value, HasKeyboard, always returns 1 because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t consider the status of slide-out keyboard. :-(\nWindows Mobile doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a standard API for detecting a status of slide-out keyboard so each device maker has to provide its own hidden or public API. For Samsung Windows Mobile devices, Samsung provides Windows Mobile SDK from the Samsung Mobile Innovator site so we can easily get a state of the slide-out keyboard on Samsung devices. However, HTC doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide any document on how to use device APIs.\nAs a result, some hackers had tried to find out how to use hidden APIs for accessing hardware features of HTC devices, but there is no API about slide-out keyboard.\nAnyway, Fennec has a bug with detecting the state of slide-out keyboard, which seemed easy to solve. At least, it was easy for my i780, but my first patch couldn\u0026rsquo;t support HTC touch pro that has a side-out keyboard.\nI tried to check most of the registry values if there is any change. Finally, I found the value from HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\GDI\\Rotation\\Slidekey. That made me fix the bug easily. :-)\n","date":"August 27, 2009","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/post/chrome_graphics_ozone_arch-458x225_huc10e897e5bf2f6907589761d46b219dd_55810_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"img-fluid w-100 rounded\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/chrome_graphics_ozone_arch-458x225_huc10e897e5bf2f6907589761d46b219dd_55810_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\n \n \n \n\n","permalink":"/blog/how-to-check-hardware-keyboard-on/","tags":["fennec","Windows Mobile"],"title":"Fixing a hardware keyboard problem in Mobile Firefox for Windows Mobile "},{"categories":null,"contents":"\u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3642/3500831169_1a68ac0aff.jpg\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;SAMSUNG Windows Mobile SDK\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\nSamsung Windows Mobile SDK 1.0 was released!\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; You can download Samsung Windows Mobile SDK 1.0 from SAMSUNG Mobile Innovator web site, but it needs to be registered for downloading.

Firstly, we enjoyed an interesting video of introducing the new features of Firefox3 and some photos of the Mozilla Korea Community activities.\n\u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3172/2605495028_64f0427df9_m.jpg\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\nSecondly, we had a Q\u0026amp;A time with Michell Baker. She kindly gave us answers about many questions regarding Mozilla/Firefox despite the late time and busy schedule. It left me wondering where she got her power \u0026amp; passion.\nAs the chair of the Mozilla foundation, she has striven to make the people all over the world access the Web equally without any restrictions. So I think that those efforts make her more powerful and active.\nThanks, Mozilla for keeping the Web for everyone; I will also help Mozilla spread Firefox.\nPhoto by Gen Kanai\n","date":"May 31, 2008","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/post/chrome_graphics_ozone_arch-458x225_huc10e897e5bf2f6907589761d46b219dd_55810_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"img-fluid w-100 rounded\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/chrome_graphics_ozone_arch-458x225_huc10e897e5bf2f6907589761d46b219dd_55810_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\n \n \n \n\n","permalink":"/blog/firefox-party-seoul/","tags":["Mozilla","Firefox3"],"title":"Firefox Seoul Party for celebrating the release of Firefox3"},{"categories":null,"contents":"The plan of Mobile Firefox was announced in October last year and the Mozilla community is now very busy to develop Mobile Firefox.\nFennec is the code name of Mobile Firefox, which is a desert fox. You may have seen a fennec in TV animation. The size of fennec is smaller than normal fox and it has big ears. So I think the name of Fennec seems to be suited well for Mobile Firefox.\nThe Mozilla Community opened the source code of Fennec and a guide of how to build it. It is a little bit intricate to build it because it is not merged into the Mozilla trunk.\nAfter build and run, you can see the following appearance.\n\u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2310/2498965336_6d3c0948b6.jpg\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;Fennec (Mobile Firefox) on N810\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2035/2499190736_1555765c5e.jpg\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;Flock: Editing Bookmark\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\nThe basic features of browser were already implemented such as the navigation bar and bookmark menu. But, panning is a little bit slow and zooming is not working in the latest code.\nFennec can be built in Maemo Scratchbox and run on XULRunner so I\u0026rsquo;ll post a way of how to build and run in N810 later. It would be helpful if you give any feedbacks to the Mozilla community after testing Fennec.\nReferences\nMozilla and Mobile Creating Nightly or “on change” ARM builds for Fennec Mozilla\u0026amp;rsquo;s Fennec May Be Just What Mobile Browsing Needs ","date":"May 18, 2008","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/post/chrome_graphics_ozone_arch-458x225_huc10e897e5bf2f6907589761d46b219dd_55810_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"img-fluid w-100 rounded\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/chrome_graphics_ozone_arch-458x225_huc10e897e5bf2f6907589761d46b219dd_55810_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\n \n \n \n\n","permalink":"/blog/latest-look-of-fennec-mobile-firefox/","tags":["fennec","N810","Mozilla","maemo"],"title":"Latest looks of Fennec (Mobile Firefox)"},{"categories":null,"contents":"I bought a Nokia N810 from Amazon. Actually, there are not any shopping malls selling N810 in Korea so I had to buy an N810 from the oversea shopping mall. Anyway, I am very satisfied with N810. It may be my favorite toy.\nN810 uses the Maemo platform that is based on Linux 2.6, GTK+, Matchbox and other open source projects. Scratchbox is used for its development environment that supports a cross-platform development environment. So the users can implement an application without knowing how to use a toolchain for specific target devices. In addition, we can easily install applications from the repositories using Debian packaging \u0026amp; repository system.\nI think that it\u0026rsquo;s a truly open mobile platform based on Linux. Because Nokia gave their governance of hildon to the GNOME community.\nFirst, I\u0026amp;rsquo;d like to build XUL Runner and run Fennec (Mozilla Mobile).

They are not confirmed, so you can suggest your idea \u0026amp; opinion to them.\nActually, I\u0026rsquo;m interested in implementing a camera interface for Mozilla platform. This camera interface is not so important on desktop, but it plays a important role in mobile environment. Because the users can take a photo more easily using their phone.\nThat is a reason why Mozilla Mobile has been interested in implementing Camera API on Mozilla platform.\nI think that implementing Camera API seems to be not difficult, because Mozilla already showed its video playback functionality through HTML5 element, which uses the GStreamer framework. So we can use a camera input instead of network stream. But, you should know how to use the camera input inside Mozilla.\nSome of mobile platforms provide a way of using their camera input such as Windows Mobile5.0, Maemo platform. So I\u0026rsquo;d like to introduce the APIs as follows,\nMaemoPlatform\nThere is an article which introduces how to use the Camera API\nAccording to the article, applications can access the Camera interface through a kernel API called Video4Linux. The built-in camera present in Nokia N810 looks compatible with Video-4-Linux version 2 API from the article.\nFortunately, the Maemo platform delegates all multimedia handling to the GStreamer framework. It means that developers can use the Camera API if they know only how to use the GStreamer framework on Maeme platform.\nWindows Mobile 5.0\nWindows Mobile developers can manipulate the camera input through DirectShow. But It needs to know some prior knowledge of how to use COM interface.\nMozilla Mobile is planning to support the Camera interface through JavaScript. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if Mozilla Mobile will expose the interface for the Web. Someday, the users would be able to upload their photos taken by the camera directly from Mobile Firefox to Flickr in any ways.\n","date":"April 20, 2008","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/post/chrome_graphics_ozone_arch-458x225_huc10e897e5bf2f6907589761d46b219dd_55810_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"img-fluid w-100 rounded\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/chrome_graphics_ozone_arch-458x225_huc10e897e5bf2f6907589761d46b219dd_55810_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\n \n \n \n\n","permalink":"/blog/camera-interface-in-maemo-platform/","tags":["mobile","firefox","camera"],"title":"Camera Interface on Mobile Platform"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;http://www.lg.co.kr/common/inc/imageView.jsp?file_name=/upload/LA/LAA/20080325/viewsum_ms__id45_wiz20080325112410.JPG\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\nLG Telelcom, the smallest of three telecom operators in Korea launched mobile full browsing service with an attractive fixed-rate plan that allows unlimited data download within 6 month and 1G bytes after then for 6,000 won ($6) per month.\nOther telecom operators also have provided mobile full browsing service, but the rate plan is very expensive. For example, SK telecom charges about 3072Won(3$) per 1MB for data transfer.\nThe full browser was provided by Infraware that is a Korean company. It features Ajax and zoomo-in/out so the user can use most of features of the Web.\nBut there are still limitations of using the Internet. This service is only for browsing the Web. Other kinds of network access are limited by expensive rate such as on-line game, Internet accessible applications. There is also limitation of data download although 1G bytes is large size of data.\nAnyway, this would be a significant change for mobile web in Korea.

I think this patch is valuable to use on Mobile Firefox.\nHowever, there is the following problem in this patch.\nMozilla handles some floating point values to get image information from the libpng so the patch commented those parts in the info_callback() function. (mozilla/modules/libpr0n/decoders/png/nsPNGDecoder.cpp)\nThe problem is that color management feature should get color profile information from the libpng. The following code shows the example:\nvoid\ninfo_callback(png_structp png_ptr, png_infop info_ptr)\n{\n\u0026hellip;\nif (gfxPlatform::IsCMSEnabled()) {\ndecoder-\u0026gt;mInProfile = PNGGetColorProfile(png_ptr, info_ptr,\ncolor_type, \u0026amp;inType, \u0026amp;intent);\n}\n\u0026hellip;\n}\nWe can check the value of gfx.color_management.enabled through the gfxPlatform::IsCMSEnable() method.\nIf the gfx.color_management.enabled is true, you can use the color profiles embedded in images to adjust the colors to match your computer\u0026rsquo;s display. In this case, Mozilla should call the PNGGetColorProfile() method. But this method handles floating point values.\nFortunately, Mozilla sets the value of gfx.color_management.enabled to false as default. The PNGGetColorProfile() method is not called. Nevertheless, the patch commented this part because a user may try to set the value to true.\nAnyway, the color management feature is not used basically now.\nIf Mobile Firefox should use the color management feature, the png patch needs more tweaks.\nHow do you think about that?\n","date":"January 6, 2008","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/post/chrome_graphics_ozone_arch-458x225_huc10e897e5bf2f6907589761d46b219dd_55810_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"img-fluid w-100 rounded\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/chrome_graphics_ozone_arch-458x225_huc10e897e5bf2f6907589761d46b219dd_55810_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\n \n \n \n\n","permalink":"/blog/libpng-patch-for-mozilla-firefox/","tags":["patch","Mozilla"],"title":"libpng patch for Mobile Firefox"},{"categories":null,"contents":"I attended the Korea Mozilla Community Annual Party 2007 last week which was hosted by Channy.\nChanny is the leader of KoMoCo, a contributor for localization of Firefox.

Cairo is designed to provide primitives for 2-dimensional drawing across a number of different backends\nFirefox2 has only made use of Cairo in its Gecko layout engine for rendering SVG and Canvas.\nHowever, all graphics rendering would be done through Cairo in Firefox3. The major reason of using Cairo is that SVG, Canvas, and font rendering need to use 2D vector drawing and it allows the drawing to be accelerated by GPU. In the future, Firefox is going to have the capabilities of drawing vector graphics as much as Flash so that it allows users to paint the Web in a standard way.

In addition, I have many mp3 files and video files in my iTunes music library. The problem is that I have to resize video files to move to iPod. Fortunately, iTunes can resize the video files, which have a large screen size, to play well on the iPod. Of course it takes a lot of time to covert the size of video.

However, flash memory can maintain data though the power is off. You are already experienced that your mp3 player never loses music files.\nWhat is Flash Memory?\nFlash memory is non-volatile, which means that it does not need power to maintain the information stored in the chip. In addition, flash memory offers fast read access times (though not as fast as volatile DRAM memory used for main memory in PCs) and better shock resistance than hard disks. ( from wikipedia)\nTherefore, there are many applications that use flash memory such as storage on battery-powered device like MP3 Player, mobile phone and PDA. In addition, External USB storage we are using has a flash memory.\nFlash memory is made in two forms: NOR flash and NAND flash. The name refers to the type of logic gate used in each storage cell.\nAlmost flash memory we are using to store data is NAND flash. NOR flash is used for running program like DRAM.\nAs you know, SAMSUNG is world\u0026rsquo;s largest NAND flash memory chipmaker. The market share is 60%(?). The success of Apple\u0026rsquo;s iPod enlarges the market of flash memory. So INTEL has a plan to produce NAND flash memory with Micronics that is one of the memory manufacturer in the US.\nFollowed by Hwang\u0026rsquo;s law, Samsung under Hwang has redoubled chip capacity every year since 1999, creating an industrial pattern named \u0026ldquo;Hwang\u0026rsquo;s law,\u0026rdquo; overturning the previous \u0026ldquo;Moore\u0026rsquo;s law\u0026rdquo; that had correctly observed the number of transistors per integrated circuit would double every couple of years.(from Korea times)\nAnyway, more information will be stored to flash memory for future. Flash memory may replace hard disk.\n","date":"January 2, 2006","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/post/chrome_graphics_ozone_arch-458x225_huc10e897e5bf2f6907589761d46b219dd_55810_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"img-fluid w-100 rounded\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/chrome_graphics_ozone_arch-458x225_huc10e897e5bf2f6907589761d46b219dd_55810_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\n \n \n \n\n","permalink":"/blog/flash-memory/","tags":null,"title":"Flash memory"},{"categories":null,"contents":"I have three computers.
