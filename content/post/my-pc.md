I have three computers. One is a power mac, another is a PC and the other is a notebook.  
The power Mac is very fast and provides good performance because it has two CPU.  
However, PC is very slow. It had been 4 years and 9 month after I bought.  
For a long time, I added new equipments including a DVD-RW, a 1394 port and a USB2 port to my PC.  
It has been sufficient to use my PC except CPU speed. However, the speed is always critical to use my PC after WindowsXP has been installed.  
  
However, I do not have any plan to upgrade my PC because I already bought the power mac G5, but whenever I browse web sites, the Internet Explorer is mandatory to navigate specific sites that requires the transaction. I cannot but turn on my PC.  
  
I will use the Mac & my PC simultaneously for some time.
