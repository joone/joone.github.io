I attended the Korea Mozilla Community Annual Party 2007 last week which was hosted by [Channy](http://channy.creation.net/).  
Channy is the leader of KoMoCo, a contributor for localization of Firefox. Actually, his company, Daum has supported many open source communities including KoMoCo. So, I always thank for Daum and his efforts.  
  
For more details, I'd like to share some blog articles regarding the party.
