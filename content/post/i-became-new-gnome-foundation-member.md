After I read [this blog post](http://blogs.gnome.org/gnomg/2012/01/27/apply-for-your-gnome-membership/), I applied for membership in the GNOME Foundation. Finally, my application was accepted last week. I think that my WebKitGtk+ contribution and GNOME Korea activities could count towards membership.

  

The main reason why I decided to become a GNOME foundation member is to let GNOME folks know about the GNOME Korea community([http://gnome.or.kr](http://gnome.or.kr/)). The GNOME Korea community started to translate for GNOME in 1998, and is mainly working on Korean translation([http://l10n.gnome.org/teams/ko/](http://l10n.gnome.org/teams/ko/)). Changwoo Ryu has led the Korean translation team since the early stages of GNOME. As a member of the GNOME Korea community, I organize GNOME Tech Talks every month to introduce various GNOME technologies to Korean developers and am also in charge of maintaining the GNOME Korea blog ([http://gnome-kr.blogspot.com/](http://gnome-kr.blogspot.com/)).

  

I'm really grateful to become a new GNOME foundation member. In particular, Iâ€™d like to thank Xan Lopez and Gustavo Noronha(kov) for helping me to become involved in WebKitGtk+ development. In the future, I will try to report on activities of the GNOME Korea community and my GNOME experiences through [Planet GNOME](http://planet.gnome.org/) and here.
