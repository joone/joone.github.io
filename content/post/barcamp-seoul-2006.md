Do you know the BarCamp?  
  
BarCamp is a informal meeting that don't have any subject.  
All attendee can speak anything without formality.  
Speaking only is Ok. A presentation is no problem.  
But, we have 20 minutes of speaking time include Q&A.  
  
This Barcamp was held in Korea firstly. Some companies support this Barcamp include DAUM, OnNet and TatterTools,  
  
I delighted to have an opportunity of attending the Barcamp because the number of attendee was limited to 50.  
  
I made a presentation about the story of programmers. This story is based on my blog.  
  
This BarCamp was very useful and so I would like to attend the next Barcamp.
