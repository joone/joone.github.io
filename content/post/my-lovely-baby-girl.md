Last Sunday, the 2nd of October, was the most memorable day in my  
life. Because I was married on the same day 6 years ago and I became a father for the first time. Actually, the birth was scheduled for the 13th of October, but it seems that she was born 2 weeks earlier to celebrate our wedding anniversary. :-)  She is a little bit smaller than other babies, but healthy and well.  
  
I hope that all goes well with my baby.
