Recently, ChromeOS started to support Linux applications on ChomeOS. Google hasn't allowed ChromeOS to run native applications due to security reason. Finally, they found a way to support Linux application through the container technology.  
  
It is worth to read [a discussion on CrOSVM on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15346269)Â because the original author joined the discussion. Here is the article about ChromeOS Linux container.

The interesting thing is that it is implemented with Rust. Google now seriously uses Rust of their product, which is a good news for the Rust community.
