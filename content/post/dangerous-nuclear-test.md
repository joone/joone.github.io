North Korea carried out its first nuclear bomb test on Monday (Oct. 9).  
Actually, we had anticipated their first nuclear bomb test at the end of the year.  
But, they committed the test quickly.  
I think that it is a “flagrant and brazen” violation of international opinion.  
  
Seoul has made every effort to maintain the peace of the Korean peninsula. Gaesong Industrial park and the Mt. Gumgang(Gumgansan) tour are good examples of the effort.  
  
There was good chance for North Korea in terms of the six-way talks. But the US didn't think that North Korea is a partner. They imposed sactions on North Korea such as financial. So North Korea tried to test their missile in east sea. As a result, North Korea tested nuclear weapon.  
  
Now the US has to change the altitude for North Korea. Because  
North Korea want to have diplomatic intercourse with the US.
