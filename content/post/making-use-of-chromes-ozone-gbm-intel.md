Recently, I published a blog article about [making Use Of Chrome's Ozone-GBM Intel Graphics Support On The Linux Desktop](https://01.org/blogs/joone/2018/using-chrome-os-graphics-stack-intel-based-linux-desktops). This is about using ChromeOS graphics stack for a regular Linux system.  [This article was also mentioned in Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Using-Ozone-GBM-On-Desktop).  
  
Originally, [my old colleague started working on this a long time ago](https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2014/10/23/chromium-ozone-gbm-explained), but it has been broken since then. So I have been trying to enable ozone-gbm on a Linux system because this solution would be useful for embedded systems. I'm making a Yocto recipe for this and will open it soon.
