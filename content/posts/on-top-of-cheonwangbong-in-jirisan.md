I enjoy hiking in the mountains. There are so many mountains and national parks in Korea. I think that Mt. Jirisan is the most beautiful mountain in Korea. I have hiked Mt. Jirisan several times. As you may know, Mt. Jirisan has many peaks. You can reach various peaks when you traverse the mountain ridge of Mt. Jirisan. From these peaks, you can see beautiful sights, like the one in the above photo. This photo was taken at the top of Cheonwangbong, the highest peak in Mt. Jirisan. At that time, it was winter, and the weather was very clear, as you can see. This was the first time I experienced such clear skies after hiking up Cheonwangbong. I recommend hiking up Mt. Jirisan if you have some free time.
