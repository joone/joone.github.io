Korean national football team triumphed againt Togo in their first match at the wordlcup football competition in Germany.  
It is valuable match because it is the first-ever FIFA World Cup win outside of Asia.  
  
Korea was unstable in the first half of the game. They permited the first goal of Togo. But we got two goals successively in the second half of the game with a spirited fightback.  
  
It's vey nice match. I look foward to winning the next match.
