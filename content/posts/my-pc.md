I have three computers: one is a Power Mac, another is a PC, and the other is a notebook. The Power Mac is very fast and provides good performance because it has two CPUs. However, the PC is very slow. It has been 4 years and 9 months since I bought it. Over time, I added new equipment to my PC, including a DVD-RW, a 1394 port, and a USB2 port. These additions have been sufficient for using my PC, except for the CPU speed, which has always been critical, especially after installing Windows XP.

However, I do not have any plans to upgrade my PC because I already bought the Power Mac G5. But whenever I browse websites, Internet Explorer is mandatory for navigating specific sites that require transactions. Therefore, I have no choice but to turn on my PC.

I will be using the Mac and my PC simultaneously for some time.
