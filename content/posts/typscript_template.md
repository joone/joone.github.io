If you work on Node.js or TypeScript, you may have your own initial setup for development. I have worked on several Node projects with TypeScript, and I have developed my own project starter or template. I put together the commonly used functionality and made it into a project, which I published on GitHub.

Of course, there is a similar project maintained by Microsoft, but it has too many features. I made my project starter with the level of features that I wanted. I think that it would be useful for other developers who like minimal TypeScript starters.

The following packages are ready to use, and a simple web service is also included.
- Express.js
- ESLint
- Mocha
- Chai
- Prettier
- TypeORM
- MongoDB
- Docker

In addition, it allows for easy debugging and running of your project with Visual Studio Code.
