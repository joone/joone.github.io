I'm excited to share that the explainer for the **Delayed Messages API** has been published!

ðŸ“„ [Explainer on GitHub](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers/blob/main/DelayedMessages/explainer.md)

This proposal introduces a new **web performance API** to help developers monitor `postMessage` events across windows, iframes, and web workers.

As you may know, web applications often use `postMessage` for communication between execution contexts. But these messages can sometimes be delayedâ€”stuck in the queue while the receiverâ€™s event loop is blocked by long-running tasks or overloaded with too many messages.

Such delays can make apps feel sluggish and unresponsive. And right now, itâ€™s difficult for developers to pinpoint exactly why these delays happenâ€”whether itâ€™s due to a busy thread, message queue congestion, or the overhead of serialization and deserialization.

The **Delayed Messages API** aims to solve this by exposing detailed timing metrics for `postMessage` eventsâ€”including queue wait time and blocking tasksâ€”so developers can identify performance bottlenecks and make targeted improvements.

The explainer outlines both the motivation and the initial API design.
