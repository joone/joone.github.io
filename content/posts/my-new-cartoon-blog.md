I have recently launched a new cartoon blog on the KLDP site, marking my first foray into cartoons.

Although I have been creating cartoons for my personal homepage for some time, I didn't do it regularly, and my homepage remained relatively obscure. Consequently, my cartoons did not gain much popularity or impact.

KLDP is a website dedicated to open-source, free software, and Linux. Hence, the primary focus of my cartoons is on software.

I am looking to share my cartoons on this blog in English, as the original versions are only available in Korean.

I would greatly appreciate any advice and encouragement
