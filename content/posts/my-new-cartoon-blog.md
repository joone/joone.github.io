I have started to write new cartoon blog on KLDP site.  
It is the first trial about cartoon.  
  
Actually, I have drawn cartoons on my homepage for a long time. But I did not draw frequently and my home page was unknown. As a result, my cartoons was not popluar and no effective.  
  
KLDP is an web site about open source, free software and linux.  
Therefore the main theme of my cartoon is about software.  
  
I want to share my cartoon on this blog in English. The original cartoons support for Korean only.  
  
Anyway, please give me an adivce and encourgement.  
  
Thanks.
