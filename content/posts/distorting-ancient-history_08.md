Seoul warns beijing against distorting ancient History.  
There are 3 countries in east asia such as Korea, China and Japan.  
As you know, China and Japan alway make problems.  
  
Japan have distorted their history for a long time.  
They have tried to hide their war of aggression  
  
So Seoul have Urged Tokyo not to distort history in textbooks.  
China also joined the road of distroing history with Japan. --;  
  
China is trying to hide the anicient history of Korea such as the Kingdom of Gogureyo, Balhae and making it their history.  
I think that China & Japan reveal their nature of aggression.  
  
As One of Korean, I am worrying about asian future.
