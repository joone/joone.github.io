PlayStation 3 will be released at the end of this year. It seems to be the last hope for Sony, which is facing a decline in profits. Notably, Sony stuck with the Trinitron TV, the most popular analog TV in the '90s, and consequently was late to enter the DTV market. Sony's lack of investment in LCD panels or PDPs meant they could not produce better digital TVs than their competitors.

The PS3 will be available in two configurations: one version with a 60GB hard drive priced at $599, and a second version with a 20GB hard drive at $499.

Based on the Cell processor, the PS3 will support Blu-ray media and include built-in Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, as well as Ethernet. Additionally, it features Dolby digital surround sound and supports high-definition video up to 1080p.

The console can operate up to seven wireless controllers simultaneously, and all PS3s will be equipped with a built-in hard drive, either 60GB or 20GB.

Furthermore, it supports USB, Sony Memory Sticks, Secure Digital (SD), and CompactFlash.

Indeed, it is a great gadget!

However, the PS3 will be more expensive than others, such as the Xbox 360 and Wii. High-quality graphics do not necessarily guarantee market success.

Nonetheless, competition is always beneficial for users because it could lead to lower console prices. :)
