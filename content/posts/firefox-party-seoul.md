Mitchell Baker, chair of the Mozilla foundation and Gen Kanai, Asia marketing manager, visited Korea to attend the [OECD ministerial meeting](http://www.oecdministerialseoul2008.org/en/programmee/speaker_view.html?id=81) during June 17th ~ 18th and give talks in the [Future of Global Web Technology](http://webappscon.com/fwf/2008/english.html) conference on June 19th.

Coincidentally, Mozilla had officially released Firefox3 in this period of time, so the Mozilla Korea Community hosted a Firefox Seoul party to celebrate the release of Firefox3. They also attended the party, so it made the event more exciting for the community.  
  
Before the party, I had the opportunity to have dinner with Mitchell Baker and Gen Kanai. I heard about the story of how Mitchell started her career in IT and was involved in the Mozilla project. It was an awesome story. I think she is part of the history of the Web.

So I felt like I was meeting people I was already acquainted with. In addition, he has already written about the Mozilla Korea Community activities and [the unique situation of using ActiveX controls in Korea](http://blog.mozilla.com/gen/2007/02/27/the-cost-of-monoculture/) in  his blog. So I'd like to thank him for his efforts.  

  

  
There were some events during the party. Firstly, we enjoyed [an interesting video of introducing the new features of Firefox3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbktEKwoS-E) and some photos of the Mozilla Korea Community activities.

Secondly, we had a Q&A time with Michell Baker. She kindly gave us answers about many questions regarding Mozilla/Firefox despite the late time and busy schedule. It left me wondering where she got her power & passion.  
  
As the chair of the Mozilla foundation, she has striven to make the people all over the world access the Web equally without any restrictions. So I think that those efforts make her more powerful and active.  
  
Thanks, Mozilla for keeping the Web for everyone; I will also help Mozilla spread Firefox.
