FOSDEM 2009 finished last week. Although I didn't attend FODSEM, I got a feel for what was going through through blogs and photos on Flikr. FODSEM(Free and Open Source Software Developer’s European Meeting) is a largest occasion for free/open source developers in Europe. It is relevant to various open source projects and it can be compared with OSCON(O’Reilly Open Source Convention) held in the US.  
  
  
The following projects had their own session:  
  
  
KDE, GNOME, Mozilla, X.org, Fedora+CentOS, OpenSUSE, BSD+PostgreSQL, GNUStep, Jabber, Debian, Ada, Free Java, OpenOffice, Drupal, Ruby & Rails, MySQL, Linux Kernel  
In addition, there were other projects sessions such as OpenMoko, Maemo, CMake, Webkit, Xfce, and OLPC.
