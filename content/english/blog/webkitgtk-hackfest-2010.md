I attended the [WebKitGtk+ Hackfest](http://live.gnome.org/Hackfests/WebKitGTK2010) held in the Igalia Office, located in Coruña, Spain, in this month. It was a great opportunity for me to meet the WebKitGtk+maintainers directly. This hackfest was sponsored by Collabora and Igalia. The Igalia office was very nice; it can be compared to the Google office in terms of the atmosphere. There were free snacks, beverage and game consoles in the office. Moreover, we had buffet lunch everyday. I'd like to give thanks to Collabora and Igalia for sponsoring the hackfest and the GNOME foundation for sponsoring my trip to Coruña.  
  

During the hackfest, we concentrated on hacking WebKitGtk+ to fix bugs and implement new features, only stopping to sleep and eat . Of course , [we also made time for a city tour in Courña for a quater of a day](http://www.flickr.com/photos/joone/sets/72157625444172107/ "we also made time for a city tour in Courña for a quater of a day").  
  
Gtk+ and libSoup maintainers also attended the hackfest to support WebKitGtk+ maintainers, because WebKitGtk+ depends on those libraries. Moreover, embracing Gtk+3 needs Gtk+ maintainers' help to keep the pace with Gtk+3 changes. Also, an Epiphany browser maintainer also joined the hackfest to fix Epiphany bugs together with the WebKitGtk+ maintainers.

On the first day, we listed up all work items on the chalkboard (as you can see in the above picture). When we finished each item, we rewarded ourselves with Super Mario BGM. :-) You can see the performance video as follows:  
  
[Martin finished a task! YEAH!](http://vimeo.com/17619887) from [diegoe](http://vimeo.com/user1535450) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/).  
  
During the hackfest, I worked on [viewport meta tags support](http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/73608 "viewport meta tags support") and [some missing features in the DRT test ](http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/73714 "some missing features in dump render tree") in WebKitGtk+. In addition, [I improved the webkit cache model feature](http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/73353 "I improved the webkit cache model feature"). In particular, I was pleased to finish the viewport meta tags patch. Actually, it might have been impossible without the maintainers' help: Kov, Martin, and Xan reviewed my patch carefully and improved it, so I'd like to thank them again. I'll explain the details of the viewport meta tags support later.  
  
After the hackfest, I felt like I was a member of the WebKitGtk+ development team. In the future, I will try to contribute more patches to WebKitGtk+.  
[You can also find this blogging in Korean version](http://opensoftware.kr/entry/WebKitGtk-Hackfest-2010-%ED%9B%84%EA%B8%B0 "You can also find this bloggig in Korean version"). :-)  
  
Happy New Year and Thanks again for reading!
