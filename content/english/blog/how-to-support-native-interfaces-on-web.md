[I posted an article about supporting native interfaces in Mobile Firefox.](http://joone4u.blogspot.com/2008/01/ideas-on-supporting-native-interfaces.html) Byt the way, I found information regarding my post from [here](http://www2003.org/cdrom/papers/refereed/p643/p643-barton-final.htm). This paper explained the native interfaces I talked as sensors on device and introduced how to send their sensed data to servers via the Web.  
  
The sensor means a device that reads data from the user's physical environment. By the way, I am interested in how to get data from the native interfaces via web browser. I have not considered yet how a browser sends data to a server.  
Anyway, this paper seems to be useful to extend technologies of web browser in a standard way.  
  
Getting a location data from a GPS sensor was already realized on Firefox. [Doug introduced this news in his blog and he implemented a prototype](http://dougt.wordpress.com/2008/01/16/skyhook-doggone-well-2/). I think it needs to be standardized
