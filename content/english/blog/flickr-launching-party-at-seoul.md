I attended Flickr Launching Party at Seoul.  
  
Anyone couldn't attend the party, only invited users could attend the party.  
Actually I have used Flickr for 1 year. so I have uploaded many beautiful photos on Flickr.  
  
Anyway, it was a very enjoyable party that offered games, cocktail show, and quiz.
