At last, I bought a video iPod that is the 5th generation of the iPod family. It is thinner and lighter than I expected. Using an iPod is very easy for me because I already have used iTunes on my Mac. In addition, I have many mp3 files and video files in my iTunes music library. The problem is that I have to resize video files to move to iPod. Fortunately, iTunes  can resize the video files, which have a large screen size, to play well on the iPod. Of course it takes a lot of time to covert the size of video. Anyway, It is good to enjoy the video on my new iPod when moving.
