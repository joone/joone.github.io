You may believe or not, I'm now in India. This is a business trip that include a weekend so I went to Jaipur on weekends. Jaipur is one of the cities in India. There are many good palaces and castles to see. This is a picture of a palace. The palace was made for women who lived in the palace. Because they could not go outside of the palace, so they could see a market from the window.
