Many things around me was changed these days.  
I got married so I lived with my wife in my new house.  
The office that I work was moved to another city so I come to the office by bus  
In addition, I got a new job that was unusual which I had not worked on before.  
  
Actually, these changes sometimes make me confuse.  
I am adapting myself to the new circumstances.
