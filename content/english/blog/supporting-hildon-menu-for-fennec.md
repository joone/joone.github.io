[I implemented the hildon menu for Fennec on Maemo.](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=426292)  

  
Actually, the hildon menu feature has not been decided to be added for 1.0 release.  
I'm not sure if this patch could be applied to the mainline.  
  
Mozilla platform already supports the hildon framework so it is easy to add new things for Maemo if you wish.
