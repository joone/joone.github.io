I'd like to introduce a presentation about open source in Asia.  
  
The speaker is [Gen Kanai](http://blog.mozilla.com/gen) who is working for Mozilla Corporation.  
He talked about Mozilla community & open source activities in Asia such as:  

*   Situation of Mozilla Community in Korea, China, Japan, and Taiwan
*   Three barriers to participate in Open Source Projects such as culture, language and education
*   Examples of Open Source Project in ASIA (Ruby, [Red flag linux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Flag_Linux), and [Dzongkha Debain Linux)](http://pcworld.about.com/od/linux/Bhutan-Government-comes-back-f.htm)

[The leader of Korea Mozilla Community,](http://www.mozilla.or.kr/zine/?cat=10) [Channy Yun](http://www.mozilla.or.kr/zine/?cat=10) [commented the situation of Open Source Activities in Korea.](http://www.mozilla.or.kr/zine/?cat=10)  
  
You can understand the situation of Open source in Korea from this article.  
  
Thanks
