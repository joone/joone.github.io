I bought a Nokia N810 from Amazon. Actually, there are not any shopping malls selling N810 in Korea so I had to buy an N810 from the oversea shopping mall. Anyway, I am very satisfied with N810. It may be my favorite toy.  
  
N810 uses the Maemo platform that is based on Linux 2.6, GTK+, Matchbox and other open source projects. Scratchbox is used for its development environment that supports a cross-platform development environment. So the users can implement an application without knowing how to use a toolchain for specific target devices. In addition, we can easily install applications from the repositories using Debian packaging & repository system.  
  
I think that it's a truly open mobile platform based on Linux. Because [Nokia gave their governance of hildon to the GNOME community.](http://arstechnica.com/journals/linux.ars/2007/06/14/nokia-pushes-hildon-upstream)  
  
First, [I'd like to build XUL Runner and run Fennec (Mozilla Mobile)](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=430200). It seems that it could run on N810 and Windows Mobile 6. So I'll check the status and give my feedback to the community.
