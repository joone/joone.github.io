I began to work on the Servo project. Actually, [my first open source project was Mozilla](https://joone4u.blogspot.com/search/label/Mozilla) and also I was involved in the Korea Mozilla community. During the time, I contributed to Fennec browser by [fixing bugs](https://joone4u.blogspot.com/2009/08/how-to-check-hardware-keyboard-on.html) and localization. Anyway, [this blog article](https://andreasgal.com/2017/07/19/firefox-marketshare-revisited/) motivated me work on Mozilla again.  
  
I landed [a simple patch](https://github.com/servo/servo/commit/ac877659e664897c2c2f303eb983458eab7212c7) and am working on adding [the ellipse API to Canvas API](https://github.com/servo/rust-azure/pull/272). I see many missing features so it looks like the blue ocean for me compared to the Chromium project.
