Mozilla project and Senecac college have worked together on Mozilla related research and development projects. And they are opening some courseworks for Mozilla and open source.  
  
[The results are now posted on the project wiki](http://zenit.senecac.on.ca/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) so you can find various projects and technical reports made by students. Particularly, there is the lab of "Real World Mozilla" that leads students to learn and practice how to develop on the Mozilla platform from building to testing Firefox. It is also helpful to anyone who interest on development on Mozilla because it is documented well in the wiki.  
  
In Korea, [Daum corporation](http://info.daum.net/eng/main.jsp) and Jeju national university made a open source related course together. So I think if they make and share the results related with open source projects, it will foster the proliferation of open source culture and movements in Korea.
