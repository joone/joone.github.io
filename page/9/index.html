    Today’s topic is about flash memory.
Flash memory is one of memory you are using everyday in your mobile devices.
Almost memories on your PC lose data when the power is off. However, flash memory can maintain data though the power is off. You are already experienced that your mp3 player never loses music files.
What is Flash Memory?
Flash memory is non-volatile, which means that it does not need power to maintain the information stored in the chip.

    I have three computers. One is a power mac, another is a PC and the other is a notebook.
The power Mac is very fast and provides good performance because it has two CPU.
However, PC is very slow. It had been 4 years and 9 month after I bought.
For a long time, I added new equipments including a DVD-RW, a 1394 port and a USB2 port to my PC.

    Many things around me was changed these days.
I got married so I lived with my wife in my new house.
The office that I work was moved to another city so I come to the office by bus
In addition, I got a new job that was unusual which I had not worked on before.
Actually, these changes sometimes make me confuse.
I am adapting myself to the new circumstances.

    I forgot that there was my blog in the blogger.
There are many blog sites in the internet, so I have serveral blogs such as the bloglines, livejournal, egloos, and my own blog in my web hosting server. Particularly, The egloos is a popular blog service in Korea, especially for developers, because it doesn&rsquo;t need to show any AD and provides some features which other blog service can&rsquo;t follow. For example, your blogs can be printed out a colored book.
