	지리산 천왕봉 정상에서 On the top of CheonwangBong in JiriSan
Originally uploaded by joone4u.
I enjoy hiking in the mountains. There are so many mountains and national parks in Korea. I think that Mt. Jirisan is the most beautiful mountain in Korea. I have hiked Mt. Jirisan several times. As you may know, Mt. Jirisan has many peaks. You can reach various peaks when you traverse the mountain ridge of Mt.&hellip;

	It was the conference for celebrating 10th anniversary of KLDP. KLDP is the acronym of Korea Linux Documentation Project, but now KLDP is a community group for free/open source softwares. Actually, KLDP started from a personal web site and now have developed to the largest Linux &amp; free/open source software community. As a result, KLDP now provides a lot of Linux documentation based on wiki system, open source project hosting, web boards and blogs for the community.&hellip;

	The Web is an increasingly important resource in many aspects of life: education, employment, government, commerce, health care, recreation, and more.
Howerver it is very dangerous if these resources only can be accessible for a specific web browser.
As you know, Most of people use Internet Explorer as web browser in Korea.
Internet Explorer supports incompatible features such as ActiveX, Some of JavaScript.
The problem is that Many web sites support the features include the government web sites in Korea.&hellip;

	Jaipur Hawa Mahal

You may believe or not, I&rsquo;m now in India. This is a business trip that include a weekend so I went to Jaipur on weekends. Jaipur is one of the cities in India. There are many good palaces and castles to see. This is a picture of a palace. The palace was made for women who lived in the palace. Because they could not go outside of the palace, so they could see a market from the window.&hellip;

	야후 스토어를 만든 폴 그레이엄이라는 사람이 쓴 책이다. 창업한 회사를 야후에 팔고 그림 공부를 하면서 느낀 점을 책으로 엮은 것이다. 전체 내용이 해커와 화가에 대한 것은 아니고 여러 essay가운데 하나가 바로 &ldquo;해커와 화가&quot;에 대한 이야기이다.
프로그래머지만 인문학적 지식이 많이 담겨있고 SW개발에 대하여 남다른 관점을 제시하여 색다른 느낌으로 책을 읽을 수 있었다. 특히 그림 그리기를 좋아하는 나로서는 프로그래밍과 그림 그리기는 작업 방식이 같다는 저자의 주장이 참 신선했고 충분히 동감이 갔다.
사실 SW개발과 그림 그리기는 그 결과가 어떻게 나올지 대충 예상은 가능하지만 정확하게 미리 보기는 힘들다.&hellip;

	Korean national football team triumphed againt Togo in their first match at the wordlcup football competition in Germany.
It is valuable match because it is the first-ever FIFA World Cup win outside of Asia.
Korea was unstable in the first half of the game. They permited the first goal of Togo. But we got two goals successively in the second half of the game with a spirited fightback.
It&rsquo;s vey nice match.&hellip;

	http://kldp.org/blog/2725
I have recently launched a new cartoon blog on the KLDP site, marking my first foray into cartoons.
Although I have been creating cartoons for my personal homepage for some time, I didn&rsquo;t do it regularly, and my homepage remained relatively obscure. Consequently, my cartoons did not gain much popularity or impact.
KLDP is a website dedicated to open-source, free software, and Linux. Hence, the primary focus of my cartoons is on software.&hellip;

	It has been 30 years since Apple was founded on 1 April 2006 (1976 - 2006). It was a long history than I expected compared to Microsoft. Apple is a computer manufacturer and MS is a software company. Two companies have helped each other and also have a competitive relationship. Two companies are developing different operating system, but MS is developing software for Mac. It is interesting that the first version of MS Excel was for Mac and Internet Explorer was the official web browser of Mac before releasing Safari.&hellip;

	Web 2.0 is so powerful to dominate our new life on the Internet. del.icio.us is the shared bookmark service that adopts the concept of web 2.0 and Flickr is also a good example of web 2.0.
They are using the concept of tags. We can attach tag to pictures or bookmarks. Tag is like keyword that presents the meaning of something. Before, I only classify something to one category. Now, We can classify pictures or bookmarks to several category that using tags.&hellip;
