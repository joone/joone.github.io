	Have you heard about Jeju Olle-gil (제주 올레길)[1] or Jirisan Dulle-gil(지리산 둘레길)? They are famous trails in Korea to hike in the rural areas to enjoy natural things. In particular, due to the success of Jeju Olle-gil, each provincial government is introducing new hiking courses to attract tourists. Actually, anyone can make their own hiking course, but many people don&rsquo;t know. In my case, I have one in Seoul. Therefore, I would like to introduce my hiking course in this blog.&hellip;

	It&rsquo;s already been almost 4 months since I started a new career as an open source developer. Before starting my new career, I had worked for a big electronics company and worked on open source projects such as Mozilla, Gtk+, WebKit project since 2007. The job was stable and salary was also good. However, I decided to quit my job and started to get involved in the projects as a contributor.&hellip;

Building your own browser is the best way to find bugs and fix them. Now, I&rsquo;d like to introduce how to build Chromium on your mac. I think that the latest code seems more stable(?) and provides more features.
This is a starting point to build Chromium on Mac OS X.

	I posted an email to the WebKit mailing list on the issue I mentioned in the previous blog.The email introduced a status of the inconsistent event handling during a IME composition on WebKit. Fortunately, I&rsquo;ve got quick feedbacks from the communities on each issue as follows,
Issue1) IME Composition events should be handled consistently in all ports of WebKit.
=&gt; &ldquo;This can&rsquo;t be achieved as it depends on the platform IME system.&hellip;

	I have been working on Korean Hangul composition issue in WebKitGtk. By the way, I&rsquo;ve noticed that IME Composition events are handled inconsistently in each WebKit port.
According to W3C DOM Level 3 events,
A browser should fire compositionstart, compositionupdate, and compositionend event during a composition. The textEvent event should be dispatched after a compositionend event if the composition has not been canceled. While a composition session is active, keyboard events should not be dispatched to the DOM (i.&hellip;

	Fennec is a XUL application, like Firefox based on Mozilla Platform. Therefore, it can be debugged and modified with the Firefox debugging tools you are familiar with.
XUL applications consist of several XUL, JavaScript, and CSS files, which are archived in a Jar file. In the case of Fennec, it has two jar files in fennec/chrome/. en-US.jar which has localization information, chrome.jar which has Fennec front-end code.
To modify them,&hellip;

	Finally, my patch was applied to the mainline of Mozilla and this cumbersome bug has been fixed. I am so happy to contribute to Mozilla. Here is the detail what the problem was fixed:
Windows Mobile keeps the status of hardware keyboard in the registry as follows:
&#34;HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Shell\\HasKeyboard&#34; A software keyboard can pop-up if a device doesn&rsquo;t have a hardware keyboard. However, in the case that the device has a slide-out keyboard, the value should be changed according to the status of the slide-out keyboard.&hellip;

	When you finish building Fennec for Windows Mobile, you can ask &ldquo;How can I install Fennec on my Windows Mobile handset?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Where is the installer?&rdquo;
Fennec build system creates only a zip file in the path of &ldquo;objdir/mobile/dist&rdquo;.
You might install Fennec using this zip file. But, it is cumbersome. Fortunately, the Fennnec team has released Fennec for Windows Mobile as a cab install.
&ldquo;How can they make a cab installer?&hellip;

	I was told a very good news from Blassey blog.
Doug Turner solved the test blocker of Fennec for Windows Mobile.
I was delight to hear the new because I had tried several times to run Fennec on my SAMSUNG i780 (called Mirage in Korea). I had failed to run Fennec.
Tooday, I tried to build Fennec for Windows Mobile from the trunk of Mozilla.
It is working well, but very slow on i780.&hellip;
