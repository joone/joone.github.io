    It was the conference for celebrating 10th anniversary of KLDP. KLDP is the acronym of Korea Linux Documentation Project, but now KLDP is a community group for free/open source softwares. Actually, KLDP started from a personal web site and now have developed to the largest Linux &amp; free/open source software community. As a result, KLDP now provides a lot of Linux documentation based on wiki system, open source project hosting, web boards and blogs for the community.

    The Web is an increasingly important resource in many aspects of life: education, employment, government, commerce, health care, recreation, and more.
Howerver it is very dangerous if these resources only can be accessible for a specific web browser.
As you know, Most of people use Internet Explorer as web browser in Korea.
Internet Explorer supports incompatible features such as ActiveX, Some of JavaScript.
The problem is that Many web sites support the features include the government web sites in Korea.

    Jaipur Hawa Mahal

You may believe or not, I&rsquo;m now in India. This is a business trip that include a weekend so I went to Jaipur on weekends. Jaipur is one of the cities in India. There are many good palaces and castles to see. This is a picture of a palace. The palace was made for women who lived in the palace. Because they could not go outside of the palace, so they could see a market from the window.

    Korean national football team triumphed againt Togo in their first match at the wordlcup football competition in Germany.
It is valuable match because it is the first-ever FIFA World Cup win outside of Asia.
Korea was unstable in the first half of the game. They permited the first goal of Togo. But we got two goals successively in the second half of the game with a spirited fightback.
It&rsquo;s vey nice match.

I have started to write new cartoon blog on KLDP site.
It is the first trial about cartoon.
Actually, I have drawn cartoons on my homepage for a long time. But I did not draw frequently and my home page was unknown. As a result, my cartoons was not popluar and no effective.
KLDP is an web site about open source, free software and linux.
Therefore the main theme of my cartoon is about software.

    PlayStation3 will be released at the end of this year. It seems the last hope of SONY. As you know, SONY has a problem with the profit decline. Actually, SONY adhered to the Trinitron TV that was the most popular analogue TV in 90s. As a result, they were late to join the DTV market: SONY did not invest LCD panel or PDP and so they was not able to make better digital TVs than other competitors.

    It has been 30 years since Apple was founded on 1 April 2006 (1976 - 2006). It was a long history than I expected compared to Microsoft. Apple is a computer manufacturer and MS is a software company. Two companies have helped each other and also have a competitive relationship. Two companies are developing different operating system, but MS is developing software for Mac. It is interesting that the first version of MS Excel was for Mac and Internet Explorer was the official web browser of Mac before releasing Safari.

    Web 2.0 is so powerful to dominate our new life on the Internet. del.icio.us is the shared bookmark service that adopts the concept of web 2.0 and Flickr is also a good example of web 2.0.
They are using the concept of tags. We can attach tag to pictures or bookmarks. Tag is like keyword that presents the meaning of something. Before, I only classify something to one category. Now, We can classify pictures or bookmarks to several category that using tags.
