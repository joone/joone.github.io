	South Korean president Rho Moo-hyun and North Korean leader Kim Jeong-il had a historical summit meeting at Pyungyang in North Korea.
This is the second summit between the two Koreas.
During the summit, Two leaders had several talks about Korean peace, economic investment, and reunification on North Korea.
I wish that the two Koreas could archive piece and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula.&hellip;

Flickr Launching Party at Seoul, originally uploaded by joone4u.
I attended Flickr Launching Party at Seoul.
Anyone couldn&rsquo;t attend the party, only invited users could attend the party.
Actually I have used Flickr for 1 year. so I have uploaded many beautiful photos on Flickr.
Anyway, it was a very enjoyable party that offered games, cocktail show, and quiz.&hellip;

	We are using Firefox browser that has been developed by Mozilla. As you may know, Firefox is based on the Mozilla application framework that provides a good way of supporting cross-platform for running applications.
However, supporting cross-platform has some weak points. The first weak point is performance, the second is that it can not utilize the native user interface.
Some web browsers are based on the Mozilla application framework with a native user interface.&hellip;

	Apple had leaded the personal computer market until the beginning of 80s before IBM released the IBM-PC. Apple also created new personal computer, the Macintosh that provides the GUI firstly. It was very innovative.
However, IBM-PC had become the mainstream of the personal computer. IBM opened the architecture of the computer and many computer manufacturers could make compatible IBM-PCs. Microsoft provided a DOS &amp; Windows as an OS for the PCs.&hellip;

	Do you know the BarCamp?
BarCamp is a informal meeting that don&rsquo;t have any subject.
All attendee can speak anything without formality.
Speaking only is Ok. A presentation is no problem.
But, we have 20 minutes of speaking time include Q&amp;A.
This Barcamp was held in Korea firstly. Some companies support this Barcamp include DAUM, OnNet and TatterTools,
I delighted to have an opportunity of attending the Barcamp because the number of attendee was limited to 50.&hellip;

	Next week he is going to vist Korea to address the new GPL and free software.
He plans to attend a conference &amp; serveal lecture meeting.
I think that it&rsquo;s good chance to understand the new GPL and free software from RMS directly. ( He wants to call him RMS)

	North Korea carried out its first nuclear bomb test on Monday (Oct. 9).
Actually, we had anticipated their first nuclear bomb test at the end of the year.
But, they committed the test quickly.
I think that it is a “flagrant and brazen” violation of international opinion.
Seoul has made every effort to maintain the peace of the Korean peninsula. Gaesong Industrial park and the Mt. Gumgang(Gumgansan) tour are good examples of the effort.&hellip;

There are 3 countries in east asia such as Korea, China and Japan.

Japan have distorted their history for a long time.
They have tried to hide their war of aggression
So Seoul have Urged Tokyo not to distort history in textbooks.
China also joined the road of distroing history with Japan.&hellip;

I enjoy hiking in the mountains. There are so many mountains and national parks in Korea. I think that Mt. Jirisan is the most beautiful mountain in Korea. I have hiked Mt. Jirisan several times. As you may know, Mt. Jirisan has many peaks. You can reach various peaks when you traverse the mountain ridge of Mt.&hellip;
