    I posted an article about supporting native interfaces in Mobile Firefox. Byt the way, I found information regarding my post from here. This paper explained the native interfaces I talked as sensors on device and introduced how to send their sensed data to servers via the Web.
The sensor means a device that reads data from the user&rsquo;s physical environment. By the way, I am interested in how to get data from the native interfaces via web browser.

    I have tested the microB patches based on Mozilla1.9(Firefox3 alpha6 pre.)

- The microB package contains more 200 patches and several patch sets.
- It is released with Firefox3 alpha6 pre. now.
Two kinds of test case are used.
- Tinderbox DHTML Test
- CSS Rendering
Target Device : PAX320, RAM 256MB
And I got the following results on TestGtkEmbed in Mozilla.
* Tinderbox DHTML Test:
The microB patched Mozilla is 2.

    Mozilla project and Senecac college have worked together on Mozilla related research and development projects. And they are opening some courseworks for Mozilla and open source.
The results are now posted on the project wiki so you can find various projects and technical reports made by students. Particularly, there is the lab of &ldquo;Real World Mozilla&rdquo; that leads students to learn and practice how to develop on the Mozilla platform from building to testing Firefox.

    I&rsquo;d like to share my ideas on native interface support in Mobile Firefox.
These ideas are based on Christian&rsquo;s Mobile Goal.
http://www.christiansejersen.com/blog/2007/11/20/mobile-goals/
Goal
Provide mobile web application environment which can use native interfaces.
- It can make XUL add-ons &amp; web applications use native interfaces
through JavaScript
Types of Native Interfaces
(Most of mobile platforms support APIs for easy of use for camera, GPS, contact, and etc..)
There are two types of native interface:

    There are submitted patches for Mobile Firefox on the Mozilla wiki.
http://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Patches
My colleague tried to apply the png patch to Mozilla and get a good result related to performance improvement.
As you know, we can build the libpng fixed point routines like the above patch.
(Use #define PNG_NO_FLOATING_POINT_SUPPORTED in mozilla/modules/libimg/png/mozpngconf.h )
In this case, he can get 8.6% performance improvement.
It&rsquo;s great. I think this patch is valuable to use on Mobile Firefox.

    I attended the Korea Mozilla Community Annual Party 2007 last week which was hosted by Channy.
Channy is the leader of KoMoCo, a contributor for localization of Firefox. Actually, his company, Daum has supported many open source communities including KoMoCo. So, I always thank for Daum and his efforts.
For more details, I&rsquo;d like to share some blog articles regarding the party.

    As expected, Mozilla finally has started the beta test of Firefox3 after finished the alpha8 test. Actually, the official version of Firefox3 should have been released this time. However, the release date is behind the schedule as the alpha test was recently finished. Anyway, we expect that Firefox would be officially released in the first half of next year
The major feature of Firefox is to use Cairo as the graphic engine for rendering all of things.

    I got a presentation on the future of firefox from the web
The slide introduced the coming features of firefox3 such as SVG, canvas3D, Offline and XMLHttpRequest++.
Actually, I am not sure that all features can be added to firefox3 because some features are very experimental. Anyway, I think SVG is very interesting among the new features.
SVG is a standard technology to create vector graphics on the web and even can be embedded in HTML pages

    South Korean president Rho Moo-hyun and North Korean leader Kim Jeong-il had a historical summit meeting at Pyungyang in North Korea.
This is the second summit between the two Koreas.
During the summit, Two leaders had several talks about Korean peace, economic investment, reunification on North Korea.
I wish that the two Koreas could archive piece and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula.

Flickr Launching Party at Seoul, originally uploaded by joone4u.
I attended Flickr Launching Party at Seoul.
Anyone couldn&rsquo;t attend the party, only invited users could attend the party.
Actually I have used Flickr for 1 year. so I have uploaded many beautiful photos on Flickr.
Anyway, it was a very enjoyable party that offered games, cocktail show, and quiz.
