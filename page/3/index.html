	Sometimes, we don&rsquo;t know exact requirements or expect user behaviors while developing or fix something. I fixed the file-picker modal issue in Chromium for Linux last year. At that time, the reviewer and I thought that there would be no case to pop-up multiple file-pickers, but it happened since M55 when you follow the following steps:
Enable &ldquo;Ask where to save&rdquo; in settings. Open 2 tabs of e.g.: https://sourceforge.net/projects/azureus/files/latest/download Wait for 2 downloader windows, and close/cancel/etc both Freeze or crash Here is a video to reproduce the problem.&hellip;

	Finally, Apple-style-span class was fully removed from Blink(commit).
Apple-style-span has not been produced since 2011: https://webkit.org/blog/1737/apple-style-span-is-gone, but there were still some legacy code to handle Apple-style-span class because old WebKit engines has produced it, but now the usage is quite low(&lt;=0.0001%). So, we decided to remove it from Blink at BlinkOn7. The code was executed whenever the users copy a text or run Editing APIs(document.execCommand) to keep the styles when pasting it.&hellip;

	When I stared working on Chromium, I found a bug in Chromium for Linux: the file-picker was not modal. So, while opening a file-picker, the users could control the main window. Sometimes, it caused mis-behaviors such as we were able to send an email while attaching a file.
There was already a bug and it seemed easy to fix it, but, it took 2 years to fully fix the problem.&hellip;

	I attended OSCON 2014 held in Portland, Oregon. I think Portland is the Mecca of Open Source because OSCON is held there every year and Intel Open Source Technology center is also in Hillsboro near Portland. In addition, Linus Torvalds is based in Portland.
I wanted to attend some sessions this year, but I didn&rsquo;t see many topics related to my job. There are more high-level topics above system level. Anyway, it&rsquo;s great to hear voices from web developers as a web engine developer.&hellip;

	Ozone-Wayland is an Ozone implementation of Chromium, which allows to run Crosswalk and Chromium browser natively on Wayland without any X11 dependence[1].
I have been working on Ozone-Wayland recently. There were two releases since I was involved in the development. In the latest release, I contributed the virtual keyboard support to Ozone-Wayland. You can find how it works in the following video:
The ozone-wayland team has been focusing on graphics accelerations such as WebGL, Canvas 2D, Accelerated Compositing on Wayland.&hellip;

	This year, I experienced Halloween, Thanksgiving day, and Christmas with my family for the first time since I moved to the US. There were many new things I learned about these holidays, so I’d like to share them with you.
Many Koreans know about Halloween because the young Korean people who had studied in the US started bringing Halloween customs back to South Korea and enjoying Halloween there since the 2000s and the majority of kindergartens have a Halloween costume party these days, but Halloween is still not commonly celebrated in Korea, so it’s very hard to find a person wearing a Halloween costume on the streets on Halloween.&hellip;

	Can you believe that a Kpop song reached no.1 on iTunes in 31 countries?, even though this Kpop song is not an English song, but a Korean song that is called “Gangnam style” by PSY. Actually, nobody expected that this song could become a great hit wordwide, but this song has been spread all over the world very quickly due to Youtube. In this article, I am going to talk about why “Gangnam style” became more popular than other typical Kpop idol songs.&hellip;

	It’s been almost 3 months since I started using a Nokia N9 as my secondary phone, which is a Linux based smart phone released by Nokia on October 2011. In this post, I will introduce what Nokia N9 is and how to use it in Korea, because it adopts an open source mobile platform which means that anyone can be involved with the project.
Nokia N9
Unfortunately, N9 is the first and last MeeGo phone, but it seems to be close to the Maemo platform, because it uses Qt as the UI framework and the Debian package system.&hellip;

	After I read this blog post, I applied for membership in the GNOME Foundation. Finally, my application was accepted last week. I think that my WebKitGtk+ contribution and GNOME Korea activities could count towards membership.
The main reason why I decided to become a GNOME foundation member is to let GNOME folks know about the GNOME Korea community(http://gnome.or.kr). The GNOME Korea community started to translate for GNOME in 1998, and is mainly working on Korean translation(http://l10n.&hellip;
