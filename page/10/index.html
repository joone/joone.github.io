					<time>Feb 8, 2006</time>

	At last, I bought a video iPod that is the 5th generation of the iPod family. It is thinner and lighter than I expected. Using an iPod is very easy for me because I already have used iTunes on my Mac. In addition, I have many mp3 files and video files in my iTunes music library. The problem is that I have to resize video files to move to iPod. Fortunately, iTunes can resize the video files, which have a large screen size, to play well on the iPod.&hellip;

	Today’s topic is about flash memory.
Flash memory is one of memory you are using everyday in your mobile devices.
Almost memories on your PC lose data when the power is off. However, flash memory can maintain data though the power is off. You are already experienced that your mp3 player never loses music files.
What is Flash Memory?
Flash memory is non-volatile, which means that it does not need power to maintain the information stored in the chip.&hellip;

	I have three computers: one is a Power Mac, another is a PC, and the other is a notebook. The Power Mac is very fast and provides good performance because it has two CPUs. However, the PC is very slow. It has been 4 years and 9 months since I bought it. Over time, I added new equipment to my PC, including a DVD-RW, a 1394 port, and a USB2 port.&hellip;

	I forgot that there was my blog in the blogger.
There are many blog sites in the internet, so I have serveral blogs such as the bloglines, livejournal, egloos, and my own blog in my web hosting server. Particularly, The egloos is a popular blog service in Korea, especially for developers, because it doesn&rsquo;t need to show any AD and provides some features which other blog service can&rsquo;t follow. For example, your blogs can be printed out a colored book.&hellip;
